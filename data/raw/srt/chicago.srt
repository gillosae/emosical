1531
01:30:41,930 --> 01:30:45,220

1532
01:30:45,330 --> 01:30:47,130
Velma Kelly : Well sure I'm not a complete idiot

Velma Kelly : I'd be delighted Thank you

1537
01:31:01,810 --> 01:31:05,590
Velma Kelly : Fred Casely assured me he'd get me an audition down at the Onyx

1538
01:31:06,280 --> 01:31:10,510
Velma Kelly : Then he reneged on his pledge and that was my motive for attacking him

1539
01:31:11,122 --> 01:31:15,302
Billy Flynn : Pretty fancy way of saying He's a big fat liar who welshed on a deal so I shot him

1540
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,860
Billy Flynn : Amos accused me of having an affair

1541
01:31:20,940 --> 01:31:25,720
Billy Flynn : so I told him that the charge was erroneous

1542
01:31:25,720 --> 01:31:26,660
Martin Harrison : Objection Your Honor

1543
01:31:27,100 --> 01:31:30,990
Martin Harrison : Mr Flynn is twisting this evidence to draw conclusions that are specious and

1544
01:31:30,990 --> 01:31:31,420
Billy Flynn : Erroneous

1545
01:31:31,430 --> 01:31:32,120
Martin Harrison : Exactly

1546
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:35,930
Jury : Order Order

1547
01:31:38,080 --> 01:31:40,860

1548
01:31:40,900 --> 01:31:41,895
Velma Kelly : Yes I do

1549
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:43,470
Billy Flynn : You also know that it's a crime

1550
01:31:43,470 --> 01:31:43,965
Velma Kelly : Yes

1551
01:31:43,966 --> 01:31:47,750
Billy Flynn : I mean for example if it turns out that you knew that this diary was a fake

1552
01:31:48,230 --> 01:31:53,000
Billy Flynn : I'd hate to think of you rotting in prison for the next ten years especially since you just won your freedom

1553
01:31:53,010 --> 01:31:55,190
Velma Kelly : Look all I know is what I was told

1554
01:31:59,200 --> 01:32:00,720
Billy Flynn : Oh So All right

1555
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:04,640
Billy Flynn : So you didn't find this diary in Roxie's cell

1556
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:06,060
Velma Kelly : No

1557
01:32:07,230 --> 01:32:11,570
Velma Kelly : Mama Miss Morton gave it to me She said someone sent it to her

1558
01:32:11,650 --> 01:32:15,420
Billy Flynn : Someone Any idea who this mysterious benefactor might be

1559
01:32:15,440 --> 01:32:17,200
Velma Kelly : No She didn't know

1560
01:32:17,349 --> 01:32:18,829
Billy Flynn : All right let's see if we can work this out

1561
01:32:18,830 --> 01:32:26,230
Billy Flynn : Someone who writes about reneging on pledges and erroneous charges

1562
01:32:27,150 --> 01:32:30,520
Billy Flynn : Call me crazy Doesn't that sound like a lawyer to you? A lawyer!

1563
01:32:30,810 --> 01:32:34,410
Billy Flynn : A lawyer who obviously had a sample of my client's handwriting

1564
01:32:35,080 --> 01:32:38,620
Billy Flynn : Mr Harrison didn't you ask Roxie to write out a confession for you

1565
01:32:38,690 --> 01:32:41,650
Martin Harrison : Yes But you're not suggesting I tampered with evidence are you

1566
01:32:41,650 --> 01:32:44,190
Billy Flynn : No no no no no I wouldn't Don't be ridiculous No

1567
01:32:44,190 --> 01:32:46,620
Billy Flynn : That's thoroughly and utterly absurd

1568
01:32:47,640 --> 01:32:48,910
Billy Flynn : But now that you mention it

1569
01:32:48,920 --> 01:32:50,420
Martin Harrison : Your Honor this is outrageous

1570
01:32:50,420 --> 01:32:57,140
Billy Flynn : It's outrageous I know I agree To even suggest that the prosecutor would make a thieves bargain with the notorious Velma Kelly

1571
01:32:57,150 --> 01:33:04,130
Billy Flynn : and then fabricate the very evidence that set her free just so you can win another case Your Honor and move one step closer to the Governor's Mansion

1572
01:33:04,250 --> 01:33:07,810
Billy Flynn : Why it's simply beyond all imagining

1573
01:33:07,810 --> 01:33:09,110
Jury : I'll hold you in contempt

1574
01:33:09,110 --> 01:33:11,630
Billy Flynn : No it is not even conceivable

1575
01:33:11,640 --> 01:33:14,240
Billy Flynn : But if it were wouldn't it be time to say

1576
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,920
Billy Flynn : Come clean Mr Harrison Come clean

1577
01:33:16,920 --> 01:33:19,920
Billy Flynn : Even in Chicago this kind of corruption cannot stand

1578
01:33:19,950 --> 01:33:20,860
Billy Flynn : Will not stand

1579
01:33:20,860 --> 01:33:23,080
Jury : That's enough Mr Flynn

1580
01:33:23,080 --> 01:33:26,240
Billy Flynn : I agree Your Honor It is enough

1581
01:33:27,900 --> 01:33:29,690
Billy Flynn : The defense rests

1582
01:33:34,480 --> 01:33:39,870

1585

Mary Sunshine : wondering what fate has in store for her

1587
01:33:56,000 --> 01:34:01,610
Mary Sunshine : And now a hush falls over the courtroom as the 12 men of the jury file slowly back to their seats
