Aladdin : Correction, the monkey stole it.

522

Genie : You can clap now.

806
00:45:59,760 --> 00:46:00,840
Genie : (MIMICS MIC DROP)

807
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,360
Genie : (MIMICS CHEERING)

808
00:46:03,080 --> 00:46:05,480
Genie : No, no, no. Please, please.

809
00:46:05,640 --> 00:46:08,920
Genie : You can thank me outside. In the sun.

810
00:46:09,120 --> 00:46:10,400
Genie : When you wish us out.

811
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,680
Aladdin : So, how does it work?

812
00:46:13,400 --> 00:46:15,400
Genie : You're kidding, right?

813
00:46:16,546 --> 00:46:20,981
Genie : The whole song was the instructions!

814
00:46:21,878 --> 00:46:24,671
Genie : Obviously, you can't dance and listen at the same time.

815
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:27,093
Genie : So, here's the basics. Step one, rub the lamp.

816
00:46:27,327 --> 00:46:29,620
Genie : Step two, say what you want. Step three...

817
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,648
Genie : there is no step three. See, it's that easy.

818
00:46:32,673 --> 00:46:37,128
Genie : You get three wishes... they must begin with rubbing the lamp and saying, "I wish." Got it?

819
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:37,738
Aladdin : I think so.

820
00:46:37,762 --> 00:46:38,746
Genie : Couple other rules.

821
00:46:38,747 --> 00:46:41,061
Genie : You can't wish for more wishes. Three is enough.

822
00:46:41,134 --> 00:46:43,840
Genie : Now, I can't make anybody love anybody or

823
00:46:43,867 --> 00:46:46,000
Genie : (EVIL VOICE) bring anybody back from the dead.

824
00:46:46,273 --> 00:46:48,340
Genie : (NORMAL VOICE) Feel free to interrupt me anytime you don't understand.

825
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,759
Genie : I'm kidding, don't ever interrupt me, no matter what.

826
00:46:50,806 --> 00:46:54,500
Genie : Now, I usually don't have to go through all of this... because by the time the guy gets to me,

827
00:46:54,593 --> 00:46:57,368
Genie : he pretty much knows what he wants... and it generally has to do with

828
00:46:57,614 --> 00:47:00,633
Genie : (EVIL VOICE) tons of money and power!

829
00:47:00,732 --> 00:47:03,006
Genie : (LAUGHING EVILLY)

830
00:47:03,224 --> 00:47:05,778
Genie : (NORMAL VOICE) Do me a favor, do not drink from that cup.

831
00:47:05,779 --> 00:47:09,695
Genie : I promise you there is not enough money and power on earth for you to be satisfied.

832
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:11,575
Genie : Good? So, what's your first wish?

833
00:47:11,576 --> 00:47:14,882
Aladdin : Mmm... Well, I have to think about it.

834
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:16,915
Aladdin : I mean, if there are only three...

835
00:47:16,940 --> 00:47:18,488
Aladdin : Why are there only three anyway?

836
00:47:18,513 --> 00:47:20,620
Genie : I don't know, who cares?

837
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:22,720
Aladdin : You don't know?

838
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:24,047
Aladdin : I thought you were all-knowing.

839
00:47:24,114 --> 00:47:25,474
Genie : That's 'cause you don't listen.

840
00:47:25,680 --> 00:47:27,920
Genie : I never said I was all-knowing.

841
00:47:27,980 --> 00:47:29,720
Genie : I said I was all-powerful.

842
00:47:29,745 --> 00:47:32,175
Genie : The most powerful being in the universe.

843
00:47:32,200 --> 00:47:36,240
Genie : Look, whatever I don't know, I know I can learn it. Outside in the sun.

844
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:38,039
Genie : Why are you playing hard to wish?

845
00:47:38,040 --> 00:47:40,593
Genie : I know you can't tell, but I am very pale.

846
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,387
Genie : This is sky blue. My natural pigmentation is navy.

847
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:46,340
Genie : Give us some sun.

848
00:47:46,420 --> 00:47:50,262
Aladdin : Okay, Genie. I wish for you to get us out of this cave.

849
00:47:50,415 --> 00:47:54,328
Genie : Boom! Booyah! He has made his first wish!

850
00:47:54,362 --> 00:47:57,855
Genie : Thank you for choosing Carpets, Camels and Caravans. Please don't forget to tip your genie on the way out.

851
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,160
Genie : Hey. Hold yourself, kid!

852
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:01,880
Genie : (GENIE WHOOPING)

853
00:48:04,299 --> 00:48:05,579
Genie : (CONTINUES WHOOPING)

854
00:48:05,580 --> 00:48:06,600
Aladdin : Whoa.

855
00:48:06,680 --> 00:48:12,255
Genie : Man, look at this world. It's so big!

856
00:48:12,405 --> 00:48:16,600
Genie : Inside the lamp, everything is, like, brass, brass, brass!

857
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:19,226
Genie : You're like, "Oh! Is that some copper?" Nope, brass!

858
00:48:19,251 --> 00:48:26,031
Genie : Sorta the problem with the genie life... phenomenal cosmic powers, but itty-bitty living space.

859
00:48:26,158 --> 00:48:30,255
Aladdin : So, is this magic, or are you magic?

860
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,240
Genie : Eh, kind of a package deal.

861
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,320
Genie : (SNAPS FINGERS)

862
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,976
Genie : (EXCLAIMS)

863
00:48:34,977 --> 00:48:36,903
Aladdin : Can you warn me before you do that?

864
00:48:37,333 --> 00:48:38,504
Genie : Oh, you'll get used to it.

865
00:48:39,341 --> 00:48:39,995
Aladdin : Right.

866
00:48:40,675 --> 00:48:42,920
Aladdin : So, do I have to make all my wishes here?

867
00:48:43,104 --> 00:48:45,585
Aladdin : I mean, if I take you back to Agrabah, won't people...?

868
00:48:45,586 --> 00:48:48,480
Genie : No, no, no! I can look totally normal.

869
00:48:48,560 --> 00:48:49,560
Genie : Boo!

870
00:48:50,120 --> 00:48:51,766
Aladdin : Right, totally normal.

871
00:48:51,880 --> 00:48:53,106
Genie : (EXCLAIMS)

872
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:54,720
Aladdin : Still blue.

873
00:48:56,279 --> 00:48:57,279
Genie : (EXCLAIMS)

874
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:58,899
Aladdin : Do we need the top knot?

875
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:00,894
Genie : That's my little cherry on top!

876
00:49:01,087 --> 00:49:02,300
Aladdin : Okay, okay.

877
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:06,253
Genie : So, what are you gonna wish?

878
00:49:06,766 --> 00:49:08,613
Aladdin : Oh, I haven't thought about that.

879
00:49:08,686 --> 00:49:11,480
Genie : Mmm. You really are not that guy.

880
00:49:12,516 --> 00:49:13,200
Aladdin : Okay.

881
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:14,799
Genie : So, what would you wish for?

882
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:15,760
Genie : Mmm.

883
00:49:17,520 --> 00:49:20,360
Genie : No one's ever asked me that before.

884
00:49:21,320 --> 00:49:22,840
Genie : It's an easy one, though.

885
00:49:23,440 --> 00:49:25,080
Genie : I'd wish to be free.

886
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:28,480
Genie : To not have to say, "Poof! Can I help you?"

887
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,345
Genie : "Poof! What would you like?"

888
00:49:30,859 --> 00:49:33,559
Genie : "Welcome to the lamp. May I take your order, please?"

889
00:49:33,659 --> 00:49:38,280
Genie : Freedom. I wish to be... to be human.

890
00:49:38,440 --> 00:49:39,993
Aladdin : Why don't you just set yourself free?

891
00:49:40,039 --> 00:49:41,600
Genie : (LAUGHING)

892
00:49:43,320 --> 00:49:48,120
Genie : Carpet! Did you hear what this boy said? Why don't I set myself free?

893
00:49:49,280 --> 00:49:52,906
Genie : Only way a genie gets to be free... is if the owner of the lamp

894
00:49:52,993 --> 00:49:55,821
Genie : uses one of his wishes to set him free...

895
00:49:55,846 --> 00:50:00,040
Genie : and the last time that happened was, like, the fourth of Never-ary.

896
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:05,880
Aladdin : I'll do it. I've got three, right?

897
00:50:06,234 --> 00:50:07,726
Genie : Actually, you have two left.

898
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:10,419
Genie : You used one to get out of the cave. Remember?

899
00:50:10,600 --> 00:50:12,499
Aladdin : Did I? Or did you?

900
00:50:12,600 --> 00:50:14,691
Aladdin : I thought I had to be rubbing the lamp.

901
00:50:14,771 --> 00:50:17,199
Genie : Okay, little street boy. Let's rewind the tape.

902
00:50:20,571 --> 00:50:25,240
Aladdin : Okay, Genie. I wish... Ooh! Little monkey with the lamp trick!

903
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,453
Genie : Never seen that one before.

904
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,280
Genie : I'll keep my eye on you.

905
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,720
Aladdin : At least now, I can use my third wish to set you free.

906
00:50:34,240 --> 00:50:35,840
Genie : Here's the thing about wishes...

907
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:39,833
Genie : the more you have, the more you want.

908
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,000
Aladdin : That's not me.

909
00:50:42,560 --> 00:50:43,560
Genie : Mmm.

910
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,720
Genie : We'll see about that.

911
00:50:44,880 --> 00:50:46,020
Aladdin : But there is something.

912
00:50:46,033 --> 00:50:46,520
Genie : Uh-oh.

913
00:50:46,840 --> 00:50:48,259
Genie : Seen that face before.

914
00:50:48,773 --> 00:50:50,793
Genie : Who is she? Who's the girl?

915
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,880
Aladdin : She's a princess.

916
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,320
Genie : Aw, aren't they all?

917
00:50:54,480 --> 00:50:57,080
Genie : "Treat your woman like a queen," I always say.

918
00:50:57,081 --> 00:51:00,059
Aladdin : No, she's an actual princess.

919
00:51:00,133 --> 00:51:03,374
Genie : Well, I already told you, I can't make anyone love anyone,

920
00:51:03,391 --> 00:51:05,207
Aladdin : No, no. We had a connection.

921
00:51:05,800 --> 00:51:06,327
Genie : Did they?

922
00:51:08,079 --> 00:51:12,280
Aladdin : She is smart, and kind, and so beautiful.

923
00:51:12,440 --> 00:51:14,640
Aladdin : But she has to marry a...

924
00:51:16,040 --> 00:51:17,451
Aladdin : Hey! Can you make me a prince?

925
00:51:18,440 --> 00:51:22,299
Genie : There's a lot of gray area in "make me a prince."

926
00:51:22,640 --> 00:51:24,960
Genie : I could just make you a prince.

927
00:51:25,120 --> 00:51:26,120
Aladdin : Oh, no.

928
00:51:26,200 --> 00:51:28,320
Genie : Right. You'd be snuggled up with that dude for the rest of your life.

929
00:51:28,345 --> 00:51:30,273
Fake Prince : Yo, y'all seen my palace?

930
00:51:30,846 --> 00:51:35,234
Genie : Be specific with your words. The deal is in the detail.

931
00:51:35,259 --> 00:51:35,855
Aladdin : Got it.

932
00:51:35,880 --> 00:51:39,191
Genie : Which I don't really understand because if she already likes you... why change?

933
00:51:39,192 --> 00:51:41,835
Aladdin : I told you, she has to marry a prince.

934
00:51:41,860 --> 00:51:43,346
Fake Prince : I just wanna go home, man!

935
00:51:43,400 --> 00:51:45,520
Genie : Okay, I can do that.

936
00:51:46,088 --> 00:51:51,555
Genie : An official wish this time, for those of us who are counting... which now, I am one.

937
00:51:51,688 --> 00:51:54,262
Aladdin : Genie, I wish...

938
00:51:54,360 --> 00:51:55,360
Genie : Lamp.

939
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:56,560
Aladdin : Oh, sorry.

940
00:51:58,310 --> 00:52:01,079
Aladdin : All right. Genie...

941
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,359
Genie : Don't hurt him, Genie!

942
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:07,826
Aladdin : I wish to become a prince.

943
00:52:07,880 --> 00:52:09,640
Genie : Back up, boy. I need some room to work.

944
00:52:10,280 --> 00:52:11,913
Genie : I'm about to fabulize you.

945
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,206
Aladdin : (GENIE WHOOPING) Genie?

946
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:18,691
Genie : (GENIE SHOUTING)

947
00:52:19,374 --> 00:52:21,436
Genie : Little head-spinney. Better though, right?

948
00:52:21,800 --> 00:52:24,399
Aladdin : (BREATHLESSLY) I think I'm getting used to it.

949
00:52:24,602 --> 00:52:27,408
Genie : Okay, a prince, a prince.

950
00:52:27,433 --> 00:52:30,821
Genie : Obviously, the ghetto-chic is not gonna work.

951
00:52:31,340 --> 00:52:33,921
Genie : I'm feeling a periwinkle.

952
00:52:33,946 --> 00:52:35,280
Aladdin : What's periwinkle?

953
00:52:35,636 --> 00:52:37,460
Genie : No! Chartreuse.

954
00:52:37,493 --> 00:52:38,880
Genie : (GASPS) Cerise!

955
00:52:39,715 --> 00:52:40,880
Genie : Ah! (GROANS)

956
00:52:41,186 --> 00:52:41,873
Genie : The lines are all wrong.

957
00:52:41,874 --> 00:52:42,775
Aladdin : What is this?

958
00:52:42,800 --> 00:52:46,128
Genie : The color clashes with your skin tone, the silhouette is confused.

959
00:52:46,215 --> 00:52:47,215

01:19:38,098 --> 01:19:45,845
Jasmine : I'm sorry. I'm embarrassed. I mean,you've seen more of Agrabah in days than I have in an entire lifetime.
