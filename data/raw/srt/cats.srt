00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:44,144

335
00:34:44,145 --> 00:34:47,299
Mungojerrie : And say in a voice That is broken with sorrow

336
00:34:47,300 --> 00:34:50,324

Mungojerrie : The joint has gone from the oven like that

338
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:58,772

339
00:34:58,773 --> 00:35:03,476
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : Was it Mungojerrie Or Rumpleteazer

340
00:35:03,477 --> 00:35:07,646

343
00:35:16,131 --> 00:35:20,343

344
00:35:20,344 --> 00:35:24,307
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : And some of the time You would say it was weather

00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:28,075
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : We'd go through the house Like a hurricane

346

350
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:45,253
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : And when you hear A dining room smash

351
00:35:45,254 --> 00:35:49,310
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : Or up from the pantry There comes a loud crash

352
00:35:49,311 --> 00:35:54,307
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : Or down from the library Came a loud ping

353
00:35:54,308 --> 00:35:56,869
Mungojerrie;Rumpleteazer : From a vase which was commonly

354

Munkustrap : Is no British dog But a heathen Chinese

448
00:43:17,488 --> 00:43:20,105

449
00:43:20,106 --> 00:43:22,501
Munkustrap : Some came to the window Some came to the door

450
00:43:22,502 --> 00:43:25,051
Munkustrap : There were surely a dozen More likely a score

451
00:43:25,052 --> 00:43:27,795
Munkustrap : And together they started To grumble and wheeze

452
00:43:27,796 --> 00:43:30,601
Munkustrap : In their hufferysnuffery Heathen Chinese

453
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:33,236
Munkustrap : But a terrible din Is what Pollicles like

454
00:43:33,237 --> 00:43:35,859
Munkustrap : For your Pollicle dog Is a dour Yorkshire tyke

455
00:43:38,057 --> 00:43:43,039
All Cats : There are dogs out of every nation The Irish the Welsh and the Dane

00:43:53,017 --> 00:43:55,469
Munkustrap : And to those that are frisky And frolicle

460
00:43:55,470 --> 00:43:58,097
Munkustrap : That my meaning be perfectly plain

461
00:43:58,098 --> 00:44:02,929
All Cats : That my name is just Little Tom Pollicle And you better not do it again

462
00:44:02,930 --> 00:44:05,658

Munkustrap : And every dogjack of them Notable fighters

464
00:44:08,046 --> 00:44:10,317
Munkustrap : And so they stepped out With their pipers in order

465
00:44:10,318 --> 00:44:13,120
Munkustrap : Playin When the Blue Bonnets Come Over the Border

466
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:25,896

Munkustrap : Now

482
00:44:51,164 --> 00:44:54,156
Munkustrap : When these bold heroes Together assembled

483
00:44:54,655 --> 00:44:58,126
Munkustrap : The traffic all stopped And the Underground trembled

484
00:44:58,414 --> 00:45:01,860
Munkustrap : And some of the neighbours Were so much afraid

485
00:45:01,861 --> 00:45:05,016
Munkustrap : That they started to ring up The fire brigade

486
00:45:05,017 --> 00:45:08,729
Munkustrap : When suddenly up From a small basement flat

487
00:45:08,963 --> 00:45:11,900

00:45:30,775 --> 00:45:34,230
Munkustrap : Fearfully blazing

491
00:45:35,582 --> 00:45:38,809
Munkustrap : He gave a great yawn

492
00:45:39,199 --> 00:45:43,467
Munkustrap : And his jaws were amazing

493
00:45:45,369 --> 00:45:51,197
Munkustrap : And when he looked out Through the bars of the area

494
00:45:52,112 --> 00:45:55,802
Munkustrap : You never saw anything

495
00:45:55,920 --> 00:45:58,866

00:46:00,208 --> 00:46:01,859
Munkustrap : Or hairier

497
00:46:03,993 --> 00:46:06,884
Munkustrap : And what with the glare Of his eyes and his yawning

498
00:46:06,885 --> 00:46:09,411
Munkustrap : The Pekes and the Pollicles Quickly took warning

499
00:46:09,412 --> 00:46:11,553
Munkustrap : He looked to the sky And he gave a great leap

500
00:46:11,554 --> 00:46:14,118
