Beast(Prince Adam) : Hmm

22
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:45,409

Madame de la Grande Bouche : the old woman's outward appearance melted away

26
00:03:04,086 --> 00:03:05,051
Madame de la Grande Bouche : To reveal

27
00:03:05,076 --> 00:03:08,237
Madame de la Grande Bouche : a beautiful enchantress

28
00:03:15,222 --> 00:03:18,462
Beast(Prince Adam) : The prince begged for forgiveness but it was too late

29
00:03:20,210 --> 00:03:23,371
Madame de la Grande Bouche : For she had seen that there was no love in his heart

30
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:27,176
Mrs. Potts : Chip Chip Oh my

Madame de la Grande Bouche : and all who lived there

34
00:03:46,878 --> 00:03:51,944
Madame de la Grande Bouche : As days bled into years the prince and his servants were forgotten by the world

35
00:03:52,404 --> 00:03:57,558
Madame de la Grande Bouche : For the enchantress had erased all memory of them from the minds of the people they loved

36
00:03:58,625 --> 00:04:02,491
Madame de la Grande Bouche : But the rose she had offered was truly an enchanted rose

37
00:04:03,554 --> 00:04:09,394
Madame de la Grande Bouche : If he could learn to love another and earn their love in return by the time the last petal fell

38
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:11,285
Madame de la Grande Bouche : the spell would be broken

39
00:04:12,307 --> 00:04:17,823
Madame de la Grande Bouche : If not he would be doomed to remain a beast for all time

40
00:04:19,429 --> 00:04:21,031
Madame de la Grande Bouche : As the years passed

Maurice : If you think I've made all this up then why did you offer to help

848
01:01:59,285 --> 01:02:00,836
Gaston : Because I want to marry your daughter

Gaston : then he is in my way

867

Gaston : Once the wolves are finished with him Belle will have no one to take care of her but me

868
01:03:02,950 --> 01:03:09,197
LeFou : For the sake of exhausting all of our options do we maybe wanna consider a slightly less gruesome alternative

Belle : Have you really read every one of these books

956
01:09:52,921 --> 01:09:53,221
Beast(Prince Adam) : What

957
01:09:55,559 --> 01:09:57,609
Beast(Prince Adam) : Well not all of them

958
01:09:58,597 --> 01:09:59,779
Beast(Prince Adam) : Some of them are in Greek

959
01:10:01,389 --> 01:10:02,359
Belle : Was that a joke

960
01:10:04,069 --> 01:10:05,348
Belle : Are you making jokes now

961
01:10:08,074 --> 01:10:08,570
Beast(Prince Adam) : Maybe

962
01:10:43,230 --> 01:10:50,070
Belle : The air is blue and keen and cold and in a frozen sheath enrolled

963
01:10:50,095 --> 01:10:55,928
Belle : Each branch each twig each blade of grass seems clad miraculously with

964
01:10:57,920 --> 01:10:58,496
Belle : glass

965
01:11:06,304 --> 01:11:08,709
Beast(Prince Adam) : I feel as if I'm seeing it for the first time

966

Beast(Prince Adam) : Is there any more

967
01:11:17,382 --> 01:11:18,281
Belle : Um

968
01:11:21,520 --> 01:11:27,443
Belle : But in that solemn silence is heard the whisper of every sleeping thing

969
01:11:28,581 --> 01:11:30,698
Belle : Look Look at me

970
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:34,207
Belle : Come wake me up

971

Belle : For still here I be

972
01:12:07,609 --> 01:12:11,140
Belle : There's something sweet and almost kind

973
01:12:11,615 --> 01:12:14,935
Belle : But he was mean and he was coarse and unrefined

974
01:12:14,936 --> 01:12:19,378
Belle : And now he's dear and so unsure

975
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:22,487
Belle : I wonder why I didn't see it there before

976
01:12:34,011 --> 01:12:37,277
Beast(Prince Adam) : She glanced this way I thought I saw

977
01:12:37,989 --> 01:12:41,050
Beast(Prince Adam) : And when we touched She didn't shudder at my paw

978
01:12:41,351 --> 01:12:44,986
Beast(Prince Adam) : No it can't be I'll just ignore

979
01:12:45,579 --> 01:12:49,003
Beast(Prince Adam) : But then she's never looked at me That way before

980
01:13:19,302 --> 01:13:26,229
Belle : New and a bit alarming

981
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:35,347
Belle : Who'd have ever thought that this could be

982
01:13:35,372 --> 01:13:41,406
Belle : True that he's no Prince Charming

983
01:13:41,407 --> 01:13:48,388
Belle : But there's something in him That I simply didn't see

984

Beast(Prince Adam) : Waiting by an open door

1222

Beast(Prince Adam) : And be with me for evermore

1224

Beast(Prince Adam) : I rage against the trials of love

1225
01:32:43,682 --> 01:32:46,821
Beast(Prince Adam) : I curse the fading of the light

1226
01:32:48,646 --> 01:32:52,875
Beast(Prince Adam) : Though she's already flown So far beyond my reach

1553
01:58:28,490 --> 01:58:33,632
Madame de la Grande Bouche;All : Beauty and the Beast

1554
01:59:14,403 --> 01:59:18,539
How does a moment last forever

1555
01:59:18,489 --> 01:59:22,361
How can a story never die

1556
01:59:22,369 --> 01:59:26,630
It is love we must hold on to

1557
01:59:27,220 --> 01:59:30,270
Never easy but we try

1558
01:59:32,562 --> 01:59:35,869
Sometimes our happiness is captured

1559
01:59:36,390 --> 01:59:39,279
Somehow a time and place stand still

1560
01:59:40,671 --> 01:59:44,266
Love lives on inside our hearts

1561
01:59:44,859 --> 01:59:46,190
And always will

1562
01:59:49,279 --> 01:59:53,399
Minutes turn to hours

1563
01:59:53,409 --> 01:59:58,480
Days to years then gone

1564
01:59:58,489 --> 02:00:02,734
But when all else has been forgotten

1565
02:00:03,273 --> 02:00:08,608
Still our song lives on

1566
02:00:10,494 --> 02:00:14,684
Maybe some moments weren't so perfect

1567
02:00:14,690 --> 02:00:18,340
Maybe some memories not so sweet

1568
02:00:18,678 --> 02:00:22,719
But we have to know some bad times

1569
02:00:22,909 --> 02:00:26,819
Or our lives are incomplete

1570
02:00:27,790 --> 02:00:31,279
Then when shadows overtake us

1571
02:00:32,539 --> 02:00:35,961
Just when we feel all hope is gone

1572
02:00:35,970 --> 02:00:40,201
We'll hear our song and know once more

1573
02:00:40,208 --> 02:00:44,398
Our love lives on

1574
02:00:51,561 --> 02:00:56,162
Oh oh

1575
02:01:10,348 --> 02:01:10,961
How does a moment last forever

1576
02:01:10,989 --> 02:01:13,978
How does our happiness endure

1577
02:01:14,701 --> 02:01:17,465
Through the darkest of our troubles

1578
02:01:18,952 --> 02:01:22,303
Love is beauty love is pure

1579
02:01:23,542 --> 02:01:27,372
Love pays no mind to desolation

1580
02:01:27,642 --> 02:01:30,294
It flows like a river through the soul

1581
02:01:31,773 --> 02:01:35,562
Protects proceeds and perseveres

1582
02:01:35,570 --> 02:01:40,141
And makes us whole

1583
02:01:40,141 --> 02:01:44,172
Minutes turn to hours

1584
02:01:44,172 --> 02:01:48,565
Days to years then gone

1585
02:01:50,280 --> 02:01:55,194
But when all else has been forgotten

1586
02:01:55,405 --> 02:02:02,235
Still our song lives on

1587
02:02:04,021 --> 02:02:08,401
How does a moment last forever

1588
02:02:09,040 --> 02:02:16,241
When our song lives on

1589
02:02:43,683 --> 02:02:47,399
Ah

1590
02:02:52,288 --> 02:02:56,369
Tale as old as time

1591
02:02:58,035 --> 02:03:01,624
True as it can be

1592
02:03:04,049 --> 02:03:06,665
Barely even friends

1593
02:03:06,891 --> 02:03:14,041
Then somebody bends unexpectedly

1594
02:03:15,700 --> 02:03:20,193
Just a little change

1595
02:03:21,545 --> 02:03:24,644
Small to say the least

1596
02:03:24,669 --> 02:03:27,505
Both a little scared

1597
02:03:27,668 --> 02:03:30,453
Neither one prepared

1598
02:03:30,566 --> 02:03:35,410
Beauty and the Beast

1599
02:03:36,497 --> 02:03:41,672
Ever just the same

1600
02:03:42,351 --> 02:03:47,976
Ever a surprise

1601
02:03:48,225 --> 02:03:50,545
Ever as before

1602
02:03:51,128 --> 02:03:53,954
And ever just as sure

1603
02:03:54,236 --> 02:03:58,594
As the sun will rise

1604
02:03:58,619 --> 02:04:03,362
Oh

1605
02:04:05,824 --> 02:04:08,650
Hey

1606
02:04:11,672 --> 02:04:14,440
Ah

1607
02:04:14,470 --> 02:04:20,029
Ooh

1608
02:04:21,723 --> 02:04:23,722
Uhhuh

1609
02:04:23,747 --> 02:04:29,331
Ever just the same

1610
02:04:29,356 --> 02:04:33,975
And ever a surprise

1611
02:04:35,422 --> 02:04:38,220
Ever as before

1612
02:04:38,245 --> 02:04:40,730
And ever just as sure

1613
02:04:40,969 --> 02:04:45,560
As the sun will rise

1614
02:04:45,762 --> 02:04:50,027
Oh oh oh

1615
02:04:51,003 --> 02:04:54,394
Tale as old as time

1616
02:04:56,868 --> 02:05:00,273
Tune as old as song

1617
02:05:00,298 --> 02:05:02,025
Oh

1618
02:05:02,860 --> 02:05:05,644
Bittersweet and strange

1619
02:05:05,919 --> 02:05:08,795
Finding you can change

1620
02:05:08,845 --> 02:05:11,656
Learning you were wrong

1621
02:05:14,750 --> 02:05:17,702
Certain as the sun

1622
02:05:17,727 --> 02:05:20,552
Certain as the sun

1623
02:05:20,577 --> 02:05:23,591
Rising in the east

1624
02:05:23,616 --> 02:05:26,012
Tale as old as time

1625
02:05:26,504 --> 02:05:29,297
Song as old as rhyme

1626
02:05:29,486 --> 02:05:33,608
Beauty and the Beast

1627
02:05:35,341 --> 02:05:37,886
Tale as old as time

1628
02:05:38,375 --> 02:05:41,047
Song as old as rhyme

1629
02:05:41,242 --> 02:05:49,607
Beauty and the Beast

1630
02:06:16,763 --> 02:06:20,203
I was the one who had it all

1631
02:06:21,724 --> 02:06:25,363
I was the master of my fate

1632
02:06:26,644 --> 02:06:30,728
I never needed anybody in my life

1633
02:06:31,431 --> 02:06:35,608
I learned the truth too late

1634
02:06:36,138 --> 02:06:39,869
I'll never shake away the pain

1635
02:06:40,933 --> 02:06:44,848
I close my eyes but she's still there

1636
02:06:45,673 --> 02:06:50,035
I let her steal into my melancholy heart

1637
02:06:50,399 --> 02:06:55,960
It's more than I can bear

1638
02:06:56,557 --> 02:07:01,514
Now I know she'll never leave me

1639
02:07:01,653 --> 02:07:06,377
Even as she runs away

1640
02:07:06,433 --> 02:07:11,362
She will still torment me Calm me hurt me

1641
02:07:11,387 --> 02:07:15,033
Move me come what may

1642
02:07:15,957 --> 02:07:20,133
Wasting in my lonely tower

1643
02:07:20,468 --> 02:07:25,131
Waiting by an open door

1644
02:07:25,732 --> 02:07:29,506
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1645
02:07:30,851 --> 02:07:36,008
And be with me for evermore

1646
02:07:37,991 --> 02:07:41,777
I rage against the trials of love

1647
02:07:42,350 --> 02:07:46,384
I curse the fading of the light

1648
02:07:46,827 --> 02:07:51,084
Though she's already flown So far beyond my reach

1649
02:07:51,339 --> 02:07:57,149
She's never out of sight

1650
02:07:57,411 --> 02:08:02,007
Now I know she'll never leave me

1651
02:08:02,525 --> 02:08:06,593
Even as she fades from view

1652
02:08:06,618 --> 02:08:09,659
She will still inspire me

1653
02:08:09,684 --> 02:08:15,259
Be a part of everything I do

1654
02:08:16,263 --> 02:08:20,553
Wasting in my lonely tower

1655
02:08:20,861 --> 02:08:25,844
Waiting by an open door

1656
02:08:25,975 --> 02:08:29,644
I'll fool myself she'll walk right in

1657
02:08:30,234 --> 02:08:34,103
And as the long long nights begin

1658
02:08:34,741 --> 02:08:38,195
I'll think of all that might have been

1659
02:08:38,598 --> 02:08:56,529
Waiting here for evermore
