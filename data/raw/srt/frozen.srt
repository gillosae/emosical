Please Help It's my daughter

61
00:06:33,746 --> 00:06:34,674
It's the king

62
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:39,027
Trolls

63
00:06:39,028 --> 00:06:39,357
Shush

64
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:39,670
Huh?

65
00:06:39,671 --> 00:06:41,047
I'm trying to listen

66
00:06:42,198 --> 00:06:45,683
Cuties I'm going to keep you

67
00:06:46,288 --> 00:06:49,790
Your Majesty. Born with the powers or cursed?

68
00:06:49,921 --> 00:06:52,528
Born And they're getting stronger

69
00:06:53,232 --> 00:06:54,094
Here, here.

70
00:06:55,637 --> 00:07:01,158
You are lucky it wasn't her heart. The heart is not so easily changed

71
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:03,967
But the head can be persuaded

72
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:05,227
Do what you must

73
00:07:05,928 --> 00:07:08,762
I recommend we remove all magic

74
00:07:08,763 --> 00:07:12,336
Even memories of magic to be safe

75
00:07:13,657 --> 00:07:17,335
But don't worry I'll leave the fun

76
00:07:22,091 --> 00:07:23,847
She will be okay

77
00:07:23,964 --> 00:07:26,367
But she won't remember I have powers

78
00:07:26,489 --> 00:07:27,875
It's for the best

79
00:07:28,142 --> 00:07:32,879
Listen to me, Elsa. Your power will only grow.

80
00:07:34,055 --> 00:07:36,308
There is beauty in it

81
00:07:37,744 --> 00:07:40,373
But also great danger

82
00:07:40,374 --> 00:07:42,317
You must learn to control it

83
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,875
Fear will be your enemy

84
00:07:47,774 --> 00:07:52,660
No We'll protect her She can learn to control it I'm sure

85
00:07:52,661 --> 00:07:56,012
Until then We'll lock the gates

86
00:07:56,013 --> 00:08:00,639
We'll reduce the staff We will limit her contact with people

87
00:08:00,992 --> 00:08:03,950
and keep her powers hidden from everyone

88
00:08:06,473 --> 00:08:08,327
Including Anna

89
00:08:16,821 --> 00:08:17,480

94
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:50,321

704
00:47:20,775 --> 00:47:29,373
Olaf : Oh I don't know why but I've always loved the idea of summer And sun and all things hot

705
00:47:29,398 --> 00:47:32,485
Kristoff : Really I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat

706
00:47:33,042 --> 00:47:33,801
Olaf : Nope

707
00:47:34,164 --> 00:47:40,821
Olaf : But sometimes I like to close my eyes and imagine what it would be like when summer does come

708
00:47:43,943 --> 00:47:48,210
Olaf : Bees will buzz Kids will blow dandelion fuzz

709
00:47:48,211 --> 00:47:53,633
Olaf : And I'll be doing Whatever snow does in summer

710

Olaf : sand Probably getting gorgeously tanned In summer

712
00:48:03,552 --> 00:48:08,050
Olaf : I'll finally see a summer breeze Blow away a winter storm

713
00:48:08,051 --> 00:48:13,619
Olaf : And find out what happens to solid water When it gets warm

714
00:48:14,899 --> 00:48:19,189
Olaf : And I can't wait to see What my buddies all think of me

715
00:48:19,322 --> 00:48:24,218
Olaf : Just imagine how much cooler I'll be In summer

716
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:33,636
Olaf : The hot and the cold are both so intense Put them together It just makes sense

717
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:41,857
Olaf : Winter's a good time To stay in and cuddle But put me in summer and I'll be a

Olaf : Oh the sky Will be blue

Bulda : Like his peculiar brain dear

1057
01:06:05,338 --> 01:06:08,141
Trolls : His thing with the reindeer That's a little outside of nature's laws

1058
01:06:08,142 --> 01:06:09,185
Kristoff : This is not about me

1059

Bulda : So tell me dear

1065
01:06:24,612 --> 01:06:26,682
Bulda : Is it the way that he runs scared

1066
01:06:26,682 --> 01:06:28,909
Troll7 : Or that he's socially impaired

1067
01:06:28,934 --> 01:06:32,054
Troll Kid : Or that he only likes To tinkle in the woods

1068
01:06:32,071 --> 01:06:33,257
Anna : I did not need to know that

1069
01:06:33,282 --> 01:06:37,956
Troll8 : Are you holding back your fondness Due to his unmanly blondness

1070
01:06:37,981 --> 01:06:41,905
Troll9 : Or the way he covers up That he's the honest goods

1071
01:06:42,795 --> 01:06:46,352
Trolls : He's just a bit of a fixerupper He's got a couple of bugs

1072
01:06:46,353 --> 01:06:47,147
Kristoff : No I don't

1073
01:06:47,148 --> 01:06:51,422
Trolls : His isolation is confirmation Of his desperation for healing hugs

1074
01:06:51,423 --> 01:06:52,021
Anna : Aw

Hans : I figured after we married I would have to stage a little accident for Elsa

1210
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,447
Anna : Hans No Stop

1211
01:16:27,448 --> 01:16:29,129
Hans : But then she doomed herself

1212
01:16:29,376 --> 01:16:31,297
Hans : and you were dumb enough to go after her

1213
01:16:31,322 --> 01:16:31,821
Anna : Please

1214
01:16:32,214 --> 01:16:36,759

1216
01:16:39,712 --> 01:16:41,980
Hans : No you're no match for Elsa

1217
01:16:42,772 --> 01:16:48,645

1218
01:16:49,587 --> 01:16:51,115

Hans : before she died in my arms

1232

1236
01:18:02,800 --> 01:18:04,291
Hans : And sentence her to death
