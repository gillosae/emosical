00:00:57,334 --> 00:00:58,887
Agnarr : Anna Elsa

00:00:59,034 --> 00:01:00,127
Iduna : Bedtime soon

3
00:01:00,457 --> 00:01:03,965
Baby Anna : Uhoh The princess is trapped in the snow goblin's evil spell

4
00:01:03,990 --> 00:01:06,849

Baby Anna : Oh no The prince is trapped too

00:01:09,122 --> 00:01:11,662
Baby Anna : Who cares about danger when there's love

7
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:13,762
Baby Elsa : Ugh Anna Bleugh

8
00:01:13,828 --> 00:01:15,748
Baby Elsa : Kissing won't save the Forest

9
00:01:16,228 --> 00:01:18,048
Baby Elsa : The lost fairies cry out

10
00:01:19,289 --> 00:01:20,415
Baby Elsa : What sound does a giraffe make

11
00:01:20,899 --> 00:01:25,681
Baby Elsa : Never mind They wake the fairy queen who breaks the spell and saves everyone

12
00:01:25,803 --> 00:01:27,823
Baby Anna : And they all get married

13
00:01:28,016 --> 00:01:29,323
Agnarr : What are you playing

14
00:01:29,403 --> 00:01:32,211
Baby Anna : Enchanted Forest The prince and the princess

15
00:01:32,252 --> 00:01:34,924
Agnarr : That's like no enchanted forest I've ever seen

16
00:01:35,591 --> 00:01:37,771
Baby Elsa : You've seen an enchanted forest

17
00:01:37,838 --> 00:01:38,649
Baby Anna : Wait what

18
00:01:38,723 --> 00:01:40,727
Agnarr : I have Once

19
00:01:40,877 --> 00:01:43,580
Baby Anna : And you've never told us this before

20
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:46,067
Agnarr : Well I could tell you now if you

21
00:01:46,846 --> 00:01:48,172
Baby Elsa : Okay Now Tell us now

22
00:01:48,907 --> 00:01:50,304
Iduna : Are you sure about this

23
00:01:50,770 --> 00:01:51,900
Agnarr : It's time they know

24
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,593
Baby Anna : Let's make a big snowman later

25
00:01:54,618 --> 00:01:56,053
Agnarr : If they can settle and listen

26
00:01:59,057 --> 00:02:06,070
Agnarr : Far away as north as we can go stood a very old and very enchanted forest

27
00:02:06,456 --> 00:02:10,455
Agnarr : But its magic wasn't that of goblin spells and lost fairies

28
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:13,781
Agnarr : It was protected by the most powerful spirits of all

29
00:02:14,861 --> 00:02:22,027
Agnarr : those of air of fire of water and earth

30
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:30,982
Agnarr : But it was also home to the mysterious Northuldra people

31
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,781
Baby Elsa : Were the Northuldra magical like me

32
00:02:33,892 --> 00:02:36,381
Agnarr : No Elsa They were not magical

33
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:39,659
Agnarr : They just took advantage of the Forest's gifts

34
00:02:41,111 --> 00:02:46,231
Agnarr : Their ways were so different from ours but still they promised us friendship

35
00:02:47,057 --> 00:02:53,607
Agnarr : In honor of that your grandfather King Runeard built them a mighty dam to strengthen their waters

36
00:02:53,995 --> 00:02:55,360
Agnarr : It was a gift of peace

37
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:57,523
Baby Anna : That's a big gift of peace

38
00:02:57,954 --> 00:03:01,566
Agnarr : And I was so honored to get to go to the Forest to celebrate it

39
00:03:01,567 --> 00:03:02,700
Runeard : Stand tall Agnarr

40
00:03:03,748 --> 00:03:06,459
Agnarr : I wasn't at all prepared for what the day would bring

41
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:10,845
Agnarr : We let down our guard

42
00:03:13,185 --> 00:03:14,190
Agnarr : We were charmed

43
00:03:14,734 --> 00:03:15,959
Agnarr : Whoa Whoa

44
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:20,707
Agnarr : It felt so magical

45
00:03:34,781 --> 00:03:35,983
Agnarr : But something went wrong

46
00:03:39,022 --> 00:03:40,493
Agnarr : They were attacking us

47
00:03:40,813 --> 00:03:41,880
Mattias : Get behind me

48
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,558
Agnarr : It was a brutal battle

49
00:03:46,992 --> 00:03:48,147
Agnarr : Your grandfather

50
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:49,144
Young Agnarr : Father

51
00:03:49,314 --> 00:03:50,234
Agnarr : was lost

52
00:03:50,740 --> 00:03:51,220
Young Agnarr : Aah

53
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,259
Agnarr : The fighting enraged the spirits

54
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:55,124
Soldier : Look out

55
00:03:55,536 --> 00:03:58,015
Agnarr : They turned their magic against us all

56
00:04:07,596 --> 00:04:09,972
Agnarr : There was this voice

57
00:04:15,102 --> 00:04:16,989
Agnarr : and someone saved me

58
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:23,631
Agnarr : I'm told the spirits then vanished

59
00:04:24,531 --> 00:04:27,150
Agnarr : And a powerful mist covered the Forest

60
00:04:27,825 --> 00:04:30,123
Agnarr : Locking everyone out

61
00:04:34,096 --> 00:04:39,061
Agnarr : And that night I came home King of Arendelle

62
00:04:41,569 --> 00:04:45,226
Baby Anna : Whoa Papa that was epic

63
00:04:45,412 --> 00:04:48,556
Baby Anna : Whoever saved you I love them

64
00:04:49,481 --> 00:04:51,157
Agnarr : I wish I knew who it was

65
00:04:51,611 --> 00:04:53,520
Baby Elsa : What happened to the spirits

66
00:04:53,727 --> 00:04:55,261
Baby Elsa : What's in the Forest now

67
00:04:55,381 --> 00:04:56,654
Agnarr : I don't know

68
00:04:56,893 --> 00:04:58,995
Agnarr : The mist still stands

69
00:04:59,415 --> 00:05:00,619
Agnarr : No one can get in

70
00:05:01,416 --> 00:05:03,218
Agnarr : And no one has since come out

71
00:05:03,264 --> 00:05:04,578
Iduna : So we're safe

72
00:05:04,724 --> 00:05:05,504
Agnarr : Yes

73
00:05:05,881 --> 00:05:07,571
Agnarr : But the Forest could wake again

74
00:05:07,572 --> 00:05:11,640
Agnarr : And we must be prepared for whatever danger it may bring

75
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:14,660
Iduna : And on that note how about we say good night to your father

76
00:05:15,907 --> 00:05:18,180
Baby Anna : But I still have so many questions

77
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,147
Agnarr : Save them for another night Anna

78
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:23,332
Baby Anna : You know I don't have that kind of patience

79
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,959
Baby Anna : Why did Northuldra attack us anyway

80
00:05:27,013 --> 00:05:29,041
Baby Anna : Who attacks people who give them gifts

81
00:05:29,252 --> 00:05:31,417
Baby Elsa : Do you think the Forest will wake again

82
00:05:34,616 --> 00:05:36,210
Iduna : Only Ahtohallan knows

83
00:05:36,723 --> 00:05:38,201
Baby Anna : Octawhowhat

84
00:05:41,015 --> 00:05:46,618
Iduna : When I was little my mother would sing a song about a special river called Ahtohallan

85
00:05:47,104 --> 00:05:49,851
Iduna : that was said to hold all the answers about the past

86
00:05:50,221 --> 00:05:51,602
Iduna : About what we are a part of

87
00:05:52,055 --> 00:05:53,104
Baby Anna : Wow

88
00:05:53,105 --> 00:05:55,205
Baby Elsa : Will you sing it for us Please

89
00:05:56,966 --> 00:05:58,058
Iduna : Okay

90
00:05:58,272 --> 00:05:59,778
Iduna : Cuddle close

91
00:05:59,999 --> 00:06:01,346
Iduna : Scooch in

92
00:06:04,994 --> 00:06:08,058
Iduna : Where the Northwind

93
00:06:08,059 --> 00:06:11,412
Iduna : Meets the sea

94
00:06:11,413 --> 00:06:14,333
Iduna : There's a river

95
00:06:14,334 --> 00:06:17,438
Iduna : Full of memory

96
00:06:17,439 --> 00:06:22,280
Iduna : Sleep my darling safe and sound

97
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:28,958
Iduna : For in this river all is found

98
00:06:30,253 --> 00:06:33,491
Iduna : In her waters

99
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:36,364
Iduna : Deep and true

100
00:06:36,365 --> 00:06:39,483
Iduna : Lie the answers

101
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:42,130
Iduna : And a path for you

102
00:06:42,131 --> 00:06:46,454
Iduna : Dive down deep into her sound

103
00:06:46,455 --> 00:06:52,479
Iduna : But not too far or you'll be drowned

104
00:06:54,119 --> 00:07:00,138
Iduna : Yes she will sing to those who hear

105
00:07:00,139 --> 00:07:06,799
Iduna : And in her song all magic flows

106
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,132
Iduna : But can you brave what you most fear

107
00:07:12,133 --> 00:07:20,895
Iduna : Can you face what the river knows

108
00:07:20,896 --> 00:07:27,445
Iduna : Where the Northwind Meets the sea

109
00:07:27,446 --> 00:07:33,848
Iduna : There's a mother Full of memory

110
00:07:33,849 --> 00:07:38,591
Iduna : Come my darling homeward bound

111
00:07:38,592 --> 00:07:40,970
Iduna : When all is lost

112
00:07:42,243 --> 00:07:47,853
Iduna : Then all is found

113
00:07:51,456 --> 00:07:52,082
Kai : Your Majesty

114
00:07:52,143 --> 00:07:52,689
Elsa : Oh

Elsa : Do you hear that

119
00:08:04,017 --> 00:08:04,808
Kai : What

120
00:08:07,209 --> 00:08:08,275
Elsa : Never mind

121
00:08:29,058 --> 00:08:31,425
Anna : Enjoying your new permafrost Olaf

122
00:08:31,426 --> 00:08:33,601
Olaf : I'm just living the dream Anna

123
00:08:33,812 --> 00:08:36,491
Olaf : Ah How I wish this could last forever

124
00:08:38,091 --> 00:08:40,567
Olaf : And yet change mocks us with her beauty

125
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,355
Anna : What's that

126
00:08:41,489 --> 00:08:44,222
Olaf : Forgive me Maturity is making me poetic

127
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,910
Olaf : Tell me you're older and thus allknowing

128
00:08:46,911 --> 00:08:50,470
Olaf : do you ever worry about the notion that nothing is permanent

129
00:08:50,603 --> 00:08:52,489
Anna : Uh No

130
00:08:52,529 --> 00:08:53,151
Olaf : Really

131
00:08:53,152 --> 00:08:59,261
Olaf : Wow I can't wait until I'm ancient like you so I don't have to worry about important things

132
00:09:00,045 --> 00:09:01,365
Anna : That's not what I mean

133
00:09:01,366 --> 00:09:08,179
Anna : I don't worry because well I have you and Elsa and Kristoff and Sven

134
00:09:08,286 --> 00:09:11,879
Anna : and the gates are open wide and I'm not alone anymore

135
00:09:12,995 --> 00:09:15,862
Anna : Yes the wind blows a little bit colder

136
00:09:16,262 --> 00:09:18,111
Anna : And we're all getting older

137
00:09:18,149 --> 00:09:23,523
Anna : And the clouds are moving on With every autumn breeze

138
00:09:23,524 --> 00:09:26,148
Anna : Peter Pumpkin just became fertilizer

139
00:09:26,149 --> 00:09:28,870
Olaf : And my leaf's a little sadder and wiser

140
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:33,621
Anna : That's why I rely on certain certainties

141
00:09:33,622 --> 00:09:37,529
Anna : Yes some things never change

142
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,124
Anna : Like the feel of your hand in mine

143
00:09:40,125 --> 00:09:42,718
Anna : Some things stay the same

144

Anna;Olaf : Like how we get along just fine

152
00:10:12,642 --> 00:10:15,628
Kristoff : Yeah but I'm really bad at planning these things out

153
00:10:15,629 --> 00:10:18,218
Kristoff : Like candlelight and pulling of rings out

154
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:23,096
Sven : Maybe you should leave all the romantic stuff to me

155
00:10:23,097 --> 00:10:26,732
Kristoff : Yeah some things never change

156

Kristoff : Some things stay the same

158
00:10:31,958 --> 00:10:34,449
Kristoff : Like how reindeers are easier

159
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,071
Kristoff : But if I commit and I go for it

160
00:10:37,398 --> 00:10:40,045
Kristoff : I'll know what to say and do

161
00:10:40,158 --> 00:10:40,838

00:23:40,226 --> 00:23:44,605
Grand Pabbie : We have always feared Elsa's powers were too much for this world

402
00:23:44,630 --> 00:23:48,005
Grand Pabbie : Now we must pray they are enough

403

Anna : What do you mean

468
00:27:50,062 --> 00:27:55,809
Kristoff : Well if that dam broke it would send a tidal wave so big it would wash away everything on this fjord

469
00:27:55,908 --> 00:27:56,895
Anna : Everything

470
00:27:57,285 --> 00:27:59,628

Kristoff : Don't you think

475
00:28:17,793 --> 00:28:19,124

Anna : You think we're gonna die

485
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:37,308
Kristoff : No No no no

486
00:28:37,309 --> 00:28:38,325
Kristoff : We will die at some point

487
00:28:38,595 --> 00:28:40,628
Anna : I swore that I wouldn't leave her side

488
00:28:40,629 --> 00:28:43,733
Kristoff : But way far in the future we will die

489
00:28:47,482 --> 00:28:48,878
Kristoff : Don't patronize me

490
00:28:58,535 --> 00:28:59,446
Anna : Elsa

491
00:28:59,794 --> 00:29:00,935
Anna : There you are

492
00:29:01,235 --> 00:29:02,246
Anna : You okay

493
00:29:02,314 --> 00:29:03,150
Elsa : I'm fine

494
00:29:03,150 --> 00:29:04,892
Anna : Okay good

495
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:06,154
Anna : Where's Olaf

496
00:29:07,164 --> 00:29:12,540
Olaf : Um Anna Elsa Sven

497
00:29:13,676 --> 00:29:14,697
Olaf : Samantha

498
00:29:17,356 --> 00:29:20,589
Olaf : I don't even know a Samantha

499
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,492
Olaf : Whoa

500
00:29:27,124 --> 00:29:27,833
Olaf : Mm

501
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:32,575
Olaf : That's normal

502
00:29:45,595 --> 00:29:46,504
Olaf : What was that

503
00:29:48,278 --> 00:29:49,209
Olaf : Samantha

504
00:29:54,397 --> 00:29:57,904
Olaf : This will all make sense when I am older

505
00:29:58,304 --> 00:30:02,049
Olaf : Someday I will see that this makes sense

506
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:06,752
Olaf : One day when I'm old and wise I'll think back and realize

507
00:30:06,753 --> 00:30:09,530
Olaf : That these were all completely normal events

508
00:30:12,487 --> 00:30:15,916
Olaf : I'll have all the answers when I'm older

509
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:20,107
Olaf : Like why we're in this dark enchanted wood

510
00:30:20,656 --> 00:30:22,695
Olaf : I know in a couple years

511
00:30:22,835 --> 00:30:24,695
Olaf : These will seem like childish fears

512
00:30:24,696 --> 00:30:27,476
Olaf : And so I know this isn't bad it's good

513
00:30:27,581 --> 00:30:28,970
Olaf : Excuse me

514
00:30:29,791 --> 00:30:33,692
Olaf : Growing up means adapting

515
00:30:33,894 --> 00:30:37,554
Olaf : Puzzling out your world and your place

516
00:30:37,579 --> 00:30:42,046
Olaf : When I'm more mature I'll feel totally secure

517
00:30:42,047 --> 00:30:46,374
Olaf : Being watched by something with a creepy creepy face

518
00:30:56,712 --> 00:31:00,745
Olaf : See that will all make sense when I am older

519
00:31:00,746 --> 00:31:04,796
Olaf : So there's no need to be terrified or tense

520
00:31:05,935 --> 00:31:09,098
Olaf : I'll just dream about a time

521
00:31:09,099 --> 00:31:12,828
Olaf : When I'm in my agèd prime

522
00:31:12,829 --> 00:31:15,181
Olaf : Cause when you're older

523
00:31:15,363 --> 00:31:20,841
Olaf : Absolutely everything makes sense

524
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:21,789
Olaf : This is fine

525
00:31:24,964 --> 00:31:25,531
Anna : Olaf

526
00:31:30,845 --> 00:31:31,715

Anna : Ooh I think I'm gonna be sick

530
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:41,656
Olaf : I'd hold your hair back but I can't find my arms

531
00:31:49,739 --> 00:31:51,332
Elsa : Hey Stop

532
00:32:03,868 --> 00:32:04,689
Anna : Elsa

533
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,923
Anna : Let her go

Kristoff : What are these

543
00:32:49,720 --> 00:32:52,655
Elsa : Oh they look like moments in time

544
00:32:53,919 --> 00:32:55,972
Anna : What's that thing you say Olaf

545

Mattias : Did you see that

578
00:34:48,785 --> 00:34:50,057

587
00:35:06,518 --> 00:35:07,984
Olaf : It's really quite simple

588
00:35:08,181 --> 00:35:10,433
Olaf : It began with two sisters

589

611
00:35:48,269 --> 00:35:50,119
Olaf : Here's a true love's kiss

612
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:51,763
Olaf : You're not worth it

613
00:35:51,817 --> 00:35:53,794
Olaf : Guess what I'm the bad guy

614
00:35:53,819 --> 00:35:54,536
Mattias : What

615
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:58,228
Olaf : And Anna freezes to death forever

616
00:35:58,983 --> 00:35:59,922
Mattias : Oh Anna

617
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,840
Olaf : Then she unfreezes

618
00:36:01,954 --> 00:36:04,906
Olaf : Oh and then Elsa woke up the magical spirits and we were forced out of our kingdom

619
00:36:04,907 --> 00:36:10,522
Olaf : Now our only hope is to find the truth about the past but we don't have a clue how to do that except Elsa's hearing voices so we got that going for us

620
00:36:11,035 --> 00:36:12,025
Olaf : Any questions

621
00:36:15,192 --> 00:36:16,686
Olaf : I think they got it

622
00:36:18,387 --> 00:36:20,159
Mattias : Are you really Queen of Arendelle

623
00:36:20,499 --> 00:36:21,178
Elsa : I am

624
00:36:21,331 --> 00:36:24,688
Yelena : Why would nature reward a person of Arendelle with magic

625
00:36:24,689 --> 00:36:26,818
Mattias : Perhaps to make up for the actions of your people

626
00:36:26,884 --> 00:36:28,837
Yelena : My people are innocent

627
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:30,697
Yelena : We would have never attacked first

628
00:36:30,722 --> 00:36:32,068
Mattias : May the truth be found

629
00:36:32,069 --> 00:36:33,106
Anna : Mm

630
00:36:33,107 --> 00:36:34,429

Mattias : Agnarr

636
00:36:45,017 --> 00:36:46,751
Mattias : What did happen to your parents

637
00:36:47,570 --> 00:36:50,917
Anna : Our parents ship went down in the Southern Sea six years ago

638
00:36:55,859 --> 00:36:58,840
Mattias : I see him I see him in your faces

639
00:36:58,995 --> 00:36:59,738
Anna : Really

640

Mattias : Soldiers

641
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:04,205
Mattias : We may be getting on in years but we're still strong

642
00:37:04,692 --> 00:37:06,760
Mattias : And proud to serve Arendelle

643
00:37:08,014 --> 00:37:09,237
Elsa : Wait Please

644
00:37:09,989 --> 00:37:11,667
Elsa : Someone has called me here

645
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,139
Elsa : If I can just find them

646
00:37:14,139 --> 00:37:17,223
Elsa : I believe they have the answers that may help us free this forest

647
00:37:18,556 --> 00:37:20,468

Olaf : Elsa pushed me away too and didn't even say goodbye

970
00:58:08,283 --> 00:58:11,750
Anna : And you have every right to be very very mad at her

971
00:58:11,857 --> 00:58:14,283
Olaf : And you said some things never change

972
00:58:14,314 --> 00:58:18,234
Olaf : But since then everything's done nothing but change

973
00:58:18,950 --> 00:58:19,639
Anna : I know

974
00:58:20,818 --> 00:58:24,093
Anna : But look I'm still here holding your hand

975
00:58:24,966 --> 00:58:27,119
Olaf : Yeah that's a good point Anna

Anna : In a pit with no way out

988
00:59:35,639 --> 00:59:38,972
Olaf : But with a spooky pitchblack way in

989
00:59:45,491 --> 00:59:47,144
Olaf : Come on it'll be fun

990
00:59:47,411 --> 00:59:51,784
Olaf : Assuming we don't get stuck here forever no one ever finds us and you starve and I give up

991
00:59:52,434 --> 00:59:57,495
Olaf : But bright side Elsa's gotta be doing a whole lot better than we are

992

Elsa : Of course

998
01:02:41,478 --> 01:02:43,876
Elsa : Glaciers are rivers of ice

999
01:02:45,867 --> 01:02:47,881
Elsa : Ahtohallan is frozen

1000
01:02:53,286 --> 01:02:54,322
Elsa : I hear you

1001

Elsa : And I'm coming

1002

1003
01:03:06,206 --> 01:03:11,062
Elsa : But not from the cold

1004
01:03:11,063 --> 01:03:13,565
Elsa : Something is familiar

1005
01:03:13,864 --> 01:03:18,765
Elsa : Like a dream I can reach but not quite hold

1006
01:03:18,766 --> 01:03:21,248
Elsa : I can sense you there

1007

Elsa : I have always been a fortress

1011
01:03:38,814 --> 01:03:43,120
Elsa : Cold secrets deep inside

1012

01:04:24,987 --> 01:04:27,084
Elsa : I've never felt so certain

1022
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:32,533
Elsa : All my life I've been torn

1023
01:04:32,534 --> 01:04:35,163
Elsa : But I'm here for a reason

1024
01:04:35,524 --> 01:04:40,068
Elsa : Could it be the reason I was born

1025
01:04:40,069 --> 01:04:43,782
Elsa : I have always been so different

1026

Runeard : We bring Arendelle's full guard

1077
01:07:57,699 --> 01:08:00,166
Servant : But they have given us no reason not to trust them

1078
01:08:01,708 --> 01:08:03,440
Runeard : The Northuldra follow magic

1079
01:08:03,441 --> 01:08:05,326
Runeard : Which means we can never trust them

1080
01:08:05,327 --> 01:08:06,309
Elsa : Grandfather

1081
01:08:06,310 --> 01:08:09,708
Runeard : Magic makes people feel too powerful Too entitled

1082
01:08:09,709 --> 01:08:14,030
Runeard : It makes them think they can defy the will of a king

1083
01:08:14,031 --> 01:08:15,925
Elsa : That is not what magic does

1084
01:08:15,965 --> 01:08:17,338
Elsa : That's just your fear

1085
01:08:17,671 --> 01:08:19,818
Elsa : Fear is what can't be trusted

1086
01:08:27,068 --> 01:08:31,588
Runeard : You see the dam will weaken their lands so they will have to turn to me

1087
01:08:33,361 --> 01:08:37,055
Iduna : Dive down deep into her sound

1088
01:08:37,215 --> 01:08:42,340
Iduna : But not too far or you'll be drowned

1089
01:08:42,341 --> 01:08:44,087
Runeard : They will come in celebration

1090
01:08:44,329 --> 01:08:48,104
Runeard : And then we will know their size and strength

1091
01:08:49,808 --> 01:08:52,801
Runeard : As you have welcomed us we welcome you

Servant : King Runeard the dam isn't strengthening our waters

1094
01:09:16,634 --> 01:09:19,603
Servant : It's hurting the Forest It's cutting off the North

1095
01:09:19,604 --> 01:09:23,934
Runeard : Let Let's not discuss this here Let's meet on the fjord Have tea

1096
01:09:24,111 --> 01:09:25,573
Runeard : Find a solution

1097
01:09:37,282 --> 01:09:38,356
Elsa : No

1098
01:09:44,681 --> 01:09:46,001
Elsa : Anna

1099
01:09:55,001 --> 01:09:58,992
Olaf : Hmm Which lucky tunnel do we choose

1100
01:10:00,006 --> 01:10:04,279
Runeard : You see the dam will
weaken their lands so they will have to turn to me

1101
01:10:04,280 --> 01:10:07,368
Northuldra Leader : King
Runeard the dam it's hurting the Forest

1102

Anna : Elsa's found it

1103
01:10:14,071 --> 01:10:14,906
Olaf : What is it

1104
01:10:15,511 --> 01:10:17,124
Anna : The truth about the past

1105
01:10:18,404 --> 01:10:26,233
Anna : That's my grandfather attacking the Northuldra leader who wields no weapon

1106
01:10:29,289 --> 01:10:31,746
Anna : The dam wasn't a gift of peace

1107
01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:34,212
Anna : It was a trick

1108
01:10:34,529 --> 01:10:37,712
Olaf : But that goes against everything Arendelle stands for

1109
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,741
Anna : It does doesn't it

1110
01:10:42,688 --> 01:10:44,568
Anna : I know how to free the Forest

1111
01:10:45,302 --> 01:10:48,809
Anna : I know what we have to do to set things right

1112
01:10:49,514 --> 01:10:51,690
Olaf : Why do you say that so sadly

1113
01:10:52,566 --> 01:10:54,113
Anna : We have to break the dam

1114
01:10:54,597 --> 01:10:56,126
Olaf : But Arendelle will be flooded

1115
01:10:57,031 --> 01:10:59,364
Anna : That's why everyone was forced out

1116
01:10:59,770 --> 01:11:02,858
Anna : To protect them from what has to be done

1117
01:11:02,959 --> 01:11:05,000
Olaf : Oh Oh

1118
01:11:08,101 --> 01:11:09,482
Olaf : Are you okay

1119
01:11:09,976 --> 01:11:12,681
Anna : I could really use a bright side Olaf

1120
01:11:12,682 --> 01:11:17,326
Olaf : Bright side Um Turtles can breathe through their butts

1121
01:11:17,606 --> 01:11:18,128

01:11:18,152 --> 01:11:21,017
Olaf : And I see a way out

1123
01:11:22,727 --> 01:11:24,495
Anna : I knew I could count on you

1124
01:11:28,939 --> 01:11:32,401
Anna : Come on Olaf Elsa's probably on her way back right now

1125
01:11:32,402 --> 01:11:33,834
Anna : We can meet her and

1126

1158
01:14:24,119 --> 01:14:25,473
Anna : The lights are out

1159
01:14:26,459 --> 01:14:27,958
Anna : Hello darkness

1160
01:14:28,372 --> 01:14:30,424

1161
01:14:33,094 --> 01:14:35,561
Anna : I follow you around

1162

Anna : I always have

1163

Anna : But you've gone to a place I cannot find

1164
01:14:43,003 --> 01:14:49,612
Anna : This grief has a gravity It pulls me down

1165
01:14:54,316 --> 01:14:59,863
Anna : But a tiny voice Whispers in my mind

1166
01:15:02,285 --> 01:15:06,308
Anna : You are lost Hope is gone

1167

Anna : And do the next right thing

1169

Anna : Can there be a day beyond this night

1170
01:15:28,969 --> 01:15:33,249
Anna : I don't know anymore what is true

1171
01:15:34,428 --> 01:15:39,024
Anna : I can't find my direction I'm all alone

1172
01:15:39,167 --> 01:15:45,089
Anna : The only star that guided me was you

1173
01:15:45,090 --> 01:15:50,151
Anna : How to rise from the floor

1174
01:15:50,152 --> 01:15:54,180
Anna : When it's not you I'm rising for

1175
01:15:54,437 --> 01:15:58,816
Anna : Just do the next right thing

1176

1179
01:16:08,604 --> 01:16:14,538
Anna : To do the next right thing

1180
01:16:15,886 --> 01:16:19,656
Anna : I won't look too far ahead

1181
01:16:19,657 --> 01:16:23,609
Anna : It's too much for me to take

1182
01:16:24,053 --> 01:16:27,423
Anna : But break it down to this next breath

1183
01:16:28,243 --> 01:16:29,649
Anna : This next step

1184
01:16:30,418 --> 01:16:36,633
Anna : This next choice is one that I can make

1185
01:16:36,634 --> 01:16:41,163
Anna : So I'll walk through this night

1186
01:16:41,164 --> 01:16:45,950
Anna : Stumbling blindly toward the light

1187
01:16:46,248 --> 01:16:50,176
Anna : And do the next right thing

1188
01:16:51,205 --> 01:16:54,247
Anna : And with the dawn

1189
01:16:54,248 --> 01:16:56,331
Anna : What comes then

1190
01:16:56,332 --> 01:17:03,098
Anna : When it's clear that everything Will never be the same again

1191
01:17:05,138 --> 01:17:07,614
Anna : Then I'll make the choice

1192
01:17:08,426 --> 01:17:11,440
Anna : To hear that voice

1193
01:17:12,132 --> 01:17:14,758
Anna : And do

1194
01:17:15,255 --> 01:17:19,593

Elsa : I took an oath to always do what's best for Arendelle

1291
01:27:55,223 --> 01:27:58,690
Elsa : Luckily I know just what that is

1292
01:27:58,930 --> 01:28:01,810
Olaf : While I still don't know what transformation means

1293
01:28:01,943 --> 01:28:05,741
Olaf : I feel like this Forest has really changed us all

1294
01:28:10,888 --> 01:28:16,246
Kai : Presenting Her Majesty Queen Anna of Arendelle

1295
01:28:22,351 --> 01:28:24,881
Anna : Oh Hello Hi

1296
01:28:26,241 --> 01:28:28,575
Anna : Sven don't you look nice

1297
01:28:29,185 --> 01:28:31,090
Anna : Oh my goodness Olaf

1298
01:28:31,091 --> 01:28:33,122
Olaf : Charmed I'm sure

1299
01:28:34,069 --> 01:28:35,211
Anna : Charming

1300
01:28:35,212 --> 01:28:36,793
Kristoff : Your Majesty

1301
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:39,360
Anna : Kristoff

1302
01:28:40,196 --> 01:28:43,030
Anna : Aw did you boys get all dressed up for me

1303
01:28:43,055 --> 01:28:44,263
Olaf : It was Sven's idea

1304
01:28:45,297 --> 01:28:48,100
Kristoff : One hour You get this for one hour

1305
01:28:48,100 --> 01:28:49,201
Anna : That's okay

1306
01:28:49,950 --> 01:28:51,635
Anna : I prefer you in leather anyway

1307
01:28:55,499 --> 01:28:57,968
Olaf : I'm shocked you can last an hour That was brutal

1308
01:28:58,986 --> 01:29:00,825
Olaf : The things we do for love

1309
01:29:01,267 --> 01:29:03,108
Mattias : What is this crazy magic called again

1310
01:29:03,296 --> 01:29:04,454
Halima : A photograph

1311
01:29:04,455 --> 01:29:06,067
Mattias : Photograph Huh

1312
01:29:06,633 --> 01:29:07,866
Mattias : We look good

1313
01:29:07,867 --> 01:29:09,762
Anna : Halima General Mattias

1314
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:11,821
Mattias : Uh Your Majesty I'll be right back

1315
01:29:11,822 --> 01:29:14,463
Mattias : You can look at our photograph while I'm gone

1316
01:29:15,707 --> 01:29:16,543
Mattias : I'm just kidding

1317
01:29:16,663 --> 01:29:17,376
Mattias : How am I doing

1318
01:29:17,929 --> 01:29:18,731
Anna : Fantastic

1319
01:29:27,371 --> 01:29:31,490
Anna : Our lands and people now connected by love

1320
01:29:37,798 --> 01:29:39,873
Anna : Hi Gale You like it

1321
01:29:40,447 --> 01:29:43,776
Anna : Oh do you mind I've got a message for my sister

1322
01:30:04,095 --> 01:30:04,904
Elsa : Thank you

1323
01:30:07,158 --> 01:30:09,687
Elsa : Charades Friday night Don't be late

1324
01:30:09,837 --> 01:30:12,428
Elsa : And don't worry Arendelle's doing just fine

1325
01:30:12,610 --> 01:30:14,494
Elsa : Keep looking after the Forest

1326
01:30:14,651 --> 01:30:15,721
Elsa : I love you

1327
01:30:16,388 --> 01:30:18,072
Elsa : I love you too sis

1328
01:30:18,604 --> 01:30:22,539
Elsa : Hey Gale We're going for a ride wanna come

1329
01:30:26,456 --> 01:30:26,976
Elsa : You ready

1330
01:31:16,482 --> 01:31:19,642
Ah ah oh oh oh

1331
01:31:20,545 --> 01:31:23,314
Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh

1332
01:31:23,351 --> 01:31:27,220
Into the unknown

1333
01:31:27,245 --> 01:31:31,272
Into the unknown

1334
01:31:31,297 --> 01:31:37,184
Into the unknown

1335
01:31:37,209 --> 01:31:40,379
Ah ah oh oh oh

1336
01:31:40,404 --> 01:31:43,500
I can hear you but I won't

1337
01:31:43,740 --> 01:31:47,617
Some look for trouble while others don't

1338
01:31:48,220 --> 01:31:52,564
There's a thousand reasons I should go about my day

1339
01:31:52,589 --> 01:31:56,878
And ignore your whispers Which I wish would go away

1340
01:31:56,903 --> 01:31:58,223
Oh oh oh

1341
01:32:00,489 --> 01:32:02,140
Whoa oh

1342
01:32:04,353 --> 01:32:06,446
You're not a voice

1343
01:32:06,730 --> 01:32:08,680
You're just a ringing in my ear

1344
01:32:08,853 --> 01:32:11,166
And if I heard you which I don't

1345
01:32:11,191 --> 01:32:13,267
I'm spoken for I fear

1346
01:32:13,292 --> 01:32:17,313
Everyone I've ever loved is here within these walls

1347
01:32:17,338 --> 01:32:21,483
I'm sorry secret siren But I'm blocking out your calls

1348
01:32:21,563 --> 01:32:23,473
I've had my adventure

1349
01:32:23,498 --> 01:32:25,414
I don't need something new

1350
01:32:25,439 --> 01:32:29,066
I'm afraid of what I'm risking if I follow you

1351
01:32:29,093 --> 01:32:32,933
Into the unknown

1352
01:32:32,958 --> 01:32:36,995
Into the unknown

1353
01:32:37,038 --> 01:32:42,810
Into the unknown

1354
01:32:42,835 --> 01:32:46,038
Ah ah oh oh oh

1355
01:32:46,680 --> 01:32:49,640
Ah ah oh oh oh oh oh oh

1356
01:32:49,699 --> 01:32:51,472
What do you want

1357
01:32:51,680 --> 01:32:53,938
Cause you've been keeping me awake

1358
01:32:54,072 --> 01:32:58,014
Are you here to distract me so I make a big mistake

1359
01:32:58,070 --> 01:33:02,443
Or are you someone out there who's a little bit like me

1360
01:33:02,468 --> 01:33:06,485
Who knows deep down I'm not where I'm meant to be

1361
01:33:06,485 --> 01:33:08,564
Every day's a little harder

1362
01:33:08,589 --> 01:33:10,749
As I feel your power grow

1363
01:33:10,774 --> 01:33:15,989
Don't you know there's a part of me That longs to go

1364
01:33:16,129 --> 01:33:20,182
Into the unknown

1365
01:33:20,207 --> 01:33:24,242
Into the unknown

1366
01:33:24,267 --> 01:33:30,204
Into the unknown

1367
01:33:31,297 --> 01:33:33,360
Whoa oh oh

1368
01:33:33,417 --> 01:33:39,826
Are you out there Do you know me Can you feel me Can you show me

1369
01:33:39,851 --> 01:33:41,321
Ah ah oh oh

1370
01:33:41,385 --> 01:33:44,146
Ah ah oh oh

1371
01:33:44,204 --> 01:33:46,447
Ah ah oh oh

1372
01:33:46,489 --> 01:33:48,449
Ah ah oh oh

1373
01:33:48,474 --> 01:33:50,527
Ah ah oh oh

1374
01:33:50,602 --> 01:33:52,564
Ah ah oh oh

1375
01:33:52,589 --> 01:33:56,280
Ah ah oh oh

1376
01:33:56,305 --> 01:34:00,132
Where are you going Don't leave me alone

1377
01:34:00,157 --> 01:34:05,342
How do I follow you

1378
01:34:05,367 --> 01:34:11,307
Into the unknown

1379
01:34:17,017 --> 01:34:18,405
Whoo

1380
01:34:33,962 --> 01:34:36,718
Where the Northwind

1381
01:34:37,212 --> 01:34:39,865
Meets the sea

1382
01:34:40,319 --> 01:34:42,998
There's a river

1383
01:34:43,532 --> 01:34:46,271
Full of memory

1384
01:34:46,438 --> 01:34:50,732
Sleep my darling Safe and sound

1385
01:34:51,140 --> 01:34:55,598
For in this river all is found

1386
01:34:55,931 --> 01:34:59,643
All is found

1387
01:35:00,681 --> 01:35:05,282
When all is lost then all is found

1388
01:35:05,604 --> 01:35:08,294
In her waters

1389
01:35:08,702 --> 01:35:11,567
Deep and true

1390
01:35:11,887 --> 01:35:17,448
Lie the answers and a path for you

1391
01:35:18,143 --> 01:35:22,565
Dive down deep into her sound

1392
01:35:22,680 --> 01:35:27,004
But not too far or you'll be drowned

1393
01:35:28,400 --> 01:35:33,845
She will sing to those who hear

1394
01:35:33,873 --> 01:35:40,748
And in her song all magic flows

1395
01:35:41,080 --> 01:35:46,094
But can you brave what you most fear

1396
01:35:46,650 --> 01:35:53,250
Can you face what the river knows

1397
01:36:14,714 --> 01:36:20,478
Until the river's finally crossed

1398
01:36:20,489 --> 01:36:27,399
You'll never feel the solid ground

1399
01:36:27,602 --> 01:36:33,010
You have to get a little lost

1400
01:36:33,184 --> 01:36:36,104
On your way

1401
01:36:36,168 --> 01:36:40,066
To being found

1402
01:36:42,400 --> 01:36:45,719
Where the Northwind

1403
01:36:45,773 --> 01:36:48,762
Meets the sea

1404
01:36:48,855 --> 01:36:51,708
There's a mother

1405
01:36:52,215 --> 01:36:54,895
Full of memory

1406
01:36:55,228 --> 01:36:59,558
Come my darling homeward bound

1407
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:03,414
Where all is lost

1408
01:37:04,251 --> 01:37:07,772
Then all is found

1409
01:37:07,934 --> 01:37:11,067
All is found

1410
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:15,680
All is found

1411
01:37:33,447 --> 01:37:35,958
Again you're gone

1412
01:37:36,692 --> 01:37:40,268
Off on a diff'rent path than mine

1413
01:37:40,293 --> 01:37:41,906
I'm left behind

1414
01:37:41,972 --> 01:37:46,612
Wondering if I should follow

1415
01:37:46,758 --> 01:37:48,878
You had to go

1416
01:37:50,621 --> 01:37:54,075
And of course it's always fine

1417
01:37:54,249 --> 01:38:00,102
I prob'ly could catch up with you tomorrow

1418
01:38:00,382 --> 01:38:07,260
But is this what it feels like to be growing apart

1419
01:38:07,285 --> 01:38:13,822
When did I become the one Who's always chasing your heart

1420
01:38:13,847 --> 01:38:16,689
Now I turn around and find

1421
01:38:16,689 --> 01:38:20,049
I am lost in the woods

1422
01:38:20,074 --> 01:38:23,037
North is South Right is left

1423
01:38:23,087 --> 01:38:26,295
When you're gone

1424
01:38:26,473 --> 01:38:29,405
I'm the one who sees you home

1425
01:38:29,430 --> 01:38:33,189
But now I'm lost in the woods

1426
01:38:33,362 --> 01:38:39,113
And I don't know what path you are on

1427
01:38:39,138 --> 01:38:41,293
I'm lost in the woods

1428
01:38:45,373 --> 01:38:47,427
Up till now

1429
01:38:47,600 --> 01:38:52,077
The next step was a question of how

1430
01:38:52,102 --> 01:38:57,970
I never thought it was a question of whether

1431
01:38:57,995 --> 01:39:00,887
Who am I

1432
01:39:01,607 --> 01:39:04,946
If I'm not your guy

1433
01:39:04,971 --> 01:39:10,467
Where am I if we're not together

1434
01:39:10,598 --> 01:39:13,604
Forever

1435
01:39:13,629 --> 01:39:16,451
Now I know you're my true North

1436
01:39:16,476 --> 01:39:20,070
Cause I am lost in the woods

1437
01:39:20,177 --> 01:39:22,825
Up is down Day is night

1438
01:39:22,950 --> 01:39:26,445
When you're not there

1439
01:39:26,470 --> 01:39:29,663
Oh you're my only landmark

1440
01:39:29,711 --> 01:39:33,270
So I'm lost in the woods

1441
01:39:33,295 --> 01:39:38,616
Wondering if you still care

1442
01:39:38,641 --> 01:39:41,741
But I'll wait

1443
01:39:42,360 --> 01:39:45,344
For a sign

1444
01:39:45,369 --> 01:39:48,612
For a sign That I'm your path

1445
01:39:48,702 --> 01:39:51,875
Cause you are mine You are mine

1446
01:39:51,910 --> 01:39:54,063
Until then

1447
01:39:54,137 --> 01:40:00,379
I'm lost in the woods Lost in the woods

1448
01:40:00,404 --> 01:40:06,112
I'm lost in the woods

1449
01:40:06,137 --> 01:40:12,412
I'm lost in the woods

1450
01:42:02,507 --> 01:42:05,188
Show yourself right now

1451
01:42:05,213 --> 01:42:06,702
Elsa be who you are

1452
01:42:06,729 --> 01:42:08,376
Oh I will Mama I will

1453
01:42:08,675 --> 01:42:10,902
Elsa's dead Olaf's dead

1454
01:42:11,382 --> 01:42:12,711
Anna cries

1455
01:42:12,916 --> 01:42:16,974
And then a bunch of important things happen that I forgot But all that matters is I was right

1456
01:42:16,999 --> 01:42:18,760
And water has memory and thus

1457
01:42:18,757 --> 01:42:20,063
I live

1458
01:42:20,237 --> 01:42:21,252
And so do you

1459
01:42:22,822 --> 01:42:24,408
Whoa

1460
01:42:24,433 --> 01:42:25,900
We live

1461
01:42:26,101 --> 01:42:29,927
We live Oh

1462
01:42:30,007 --> 01:42:32,753
Good story
