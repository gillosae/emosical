00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:54,648
Tala : In the beginning

2
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,131
Tala : there was only ocean

3
00:00:58,226 --> 00:01:04,002
Tala : until the mother island emerged Te Fiti

4
00:01:04,721 --> 00:01:08,522
Tala : Her heart held the greatest power ever known

5
00:01:08,655 --> 00:01:11,452
Tala : It could create life itself

6
00:01:11,801 --> 00:01:15,466
Tala : And Te Fiti shared it with the world

7
00:01:18,404 --> 00:01:22,783
Tala : But in time some began to seek Te Fiti's heart

8
00:01:22,959 --> 00:01:28,643
Tala : They believed if they could possess it the great power of creation would be theirs

9
00:01:29,176 --> 00:01:31,116

10
00:01:31,858 --> 00:01:38,970
Tala : the most daring of them all voyaged across the vast ocean to take it

11
00:01:40,491 --> 00:01:44,277

13
00:01:49,585 --> 00:01:50,702
Tala : A trickster

14
00:01:53,015 --> 00:01:59,565
Tala : A shapeshifter who could change form with the power of his magical fish hook

15
00:02:01,178 --> 00:02:05,352
Tala : And his name was Maui

16
00:02:15,393 --> 00:02:22,771
Tala : But without her heart Te Fiti began to crumble giving birth to a terrible darkness

17
00:02:40,906 --> 00:02:46,327
Tala : Maui tried to escape but was confronted by another who sought the heart

18
00:02:49,217 --> 00:02:53,370
Tala : Te Kā A demon of earth and fire

19
00:03:01,617 --> 00:03:04,820
Tala : Maui was struck from the sky

20
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:07,633
Tala : never to be seen again

21
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:16,245
Tala : And his magical fish hook and the heart of Te Fiti were lost to the sea

22
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:20,720
Tala : Where even now 1000 years later

23
00:03:20,721 --> 00:03:25,404
Tala : Te Kā and the demons of the deep still hunt for the heart

24
00:03:26,044 --> 00:03:29,958
Tala : Hiding in a darkness that will continue to spread

25
00:03:30,266 --> 00:03:32,243
Tala : chasing away our fish

26
00:03:32,244 --> 00:03:35,932
Tala : draining the life from island after island

27
00:03:35,933 --> 00:03:39,707
Tala : until every one of us is devoured

28
00:03:39,708 --> 00:03:45,006
Tala : by the bloodthirsty jaws of inescapable death

29
00:03:50,334 --> 00:03:54,111
Tala : But one day the heart will be found

30
00:03:54,181 --> 00:03:58,722
by someone who will journey beyond our reef find Maui

31
00:03:58,723 --> 00:04:03,408
Tala : deliver him across the great ocean to restore Te Fiti's heart

32
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,289
Tala : and save us all

33

159
00:12:28,814 --> 00:12:30,119
Moana : So close

160
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:47,699
Villager3 : I'm curious about that chicken eating the rock

161
00:12:47,873 --> 00:12:52,907
Villager3 : He seems to lack the basic intelligence required for pretty much everything

162
00:12:53,029 --> 00:12:56,001
Villager3 : Should we maybe just cook him

163
00:12:57,121 --> 00:13:00,020
Moana : Sometimes our strengths lie beneath the surface

164
00:13:01,904 --> 00:13:04,684
Moana : Far beneath in some cases

165
00:13:04,685 --> 00:13:08,022
Moana : But I'm sure there's more to Heihei than meets the eye

166
00:13:14,810 --> 00:13:16,237
Villager4 : It's the harvest

167
00:13:16,456 --> 00:13:19,319
Villager4 : This morning I was husking the coconuts and

168
00:13:26,223 --> 00:13:29,607
Moana : Well we should clear the diseased trees

169
00:13:29,608 --> 00:13:33,483
Moana : and we will start a new grove There

170
00:13:36,049 --> 00:13:37,189
Villager4 : Thanks Moana

171
00:13:37,442 --> 00:13:39,022
Villager4 : She's doing great

172
00:13:43,656 --> 00:13:44,671
Chief Tui : This suits you

173
00:13:45,029 --> 00:13:45,391
Villager5 : Chief

174
00:13:46,308 --> 00:13:48,782
Villager5 : There's something you need to see

175
00:13:49,529 --> 00:13:53,222
Villager5 : Our traps in the east lagoon they're pulling up less and less fish

176
00:13:53,621 --> 00:13:56,059
Moana : Then we'll rotate the fishing grounds

177
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,362
Villager5 : Uh we have There's no fish

178
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:01,904
Moana : Oh Then we'll fish the far side of the island

179
00:14:01,908 --> 00:14:02,816
Villager5 : We tried

180
00:14:03,136 --> 00:14:04,518
Moana : The windward side

181
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:07,274
Villager5 : And the leeward side the shallows the channel

182
00:14:07,299 --> 00:14:08,965
Villager5 : We've tried the whole lagoon

183
00:14:09,403 --> 00:14:11,176
Villager5 : They're just gone

184
00:14:11,937 --> 00:14:13,710
Chief Tui : Have you tried using a different bait

185
00:14:13,710 --> 00:14:15,172
Villager5 : I don't think it's the bait

186
00:14:15,347 --> 00:14:16,784
Villager6 : There's no fish

187
00:14:16,935 --> 00:14:18,739
Villager5 : It seems like it's getting worse and worse

188
00:14:18,764 --> 00:14:22,092
Chief Tui : Of course I understand you have reason for concern

189
00:14:22,092 --> 00:14:24,671
Chief Tui : I will talk to the council I'm sure we

190
00:14:25,228 --> 00:14:26,708
Moana : we fish beyond the reef

191
00:14:28,507 --> 00:14:30,554
Chief Tui : No one goes beyond the reef

192
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:33,445
Moana : I know But if there are no fish in the lagoon

193
00:14:33,446 --> 00:14:33,821
Chief Tui : Moana

194
00:14:33,846 --> 00:14:35,179
Moana : And there's a whole ocean

195
00:14:35,180 --> 00:14:36,943
Chief Tui : We have one rule

196
00:14:36,944 --> 00:14:38,354
Moana : An old rule when there were fish

197
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,026
Chief Tui : A rule that keeps us safe

198
00:14:40,074 --> 00:14:40,578
Moana : But Dad I

199
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:44,112
Chief Tui : instead of endangering our people so you can run right back to the water

200
00:14:51,232 --> 00:14:54,012
Chief Tui : Every time I think you're past this

201
00:14:56,365 --> 00:14:58,525
Chief Tui : No one goes beyond the reef

202
00:15:05,139 --> 00:15:08,005
Sina : Well it's not like you said it in front of your dad

203
00:15:09,098 --> 00:15:10,326
Sina : Standing on a boat

204
00:15:10,992 --> 00:15:15,565
Moana : I didn't say go beyond the reef because I want to be on the ocean

205
00:15:15,671 --> 00:15:17,273
Sina : But you still do

206
00:15:18,886 --> 00:15:20,445
Sina : He's hard on you because

207
00:15:20,446 --> 00:15:21,493
Moana : Because he doesn't get me

208
00:15:21,573 --> 00:15:23,993
Sina : Because he was you

209
00:15:25,166 --> 00:15:26,665
Sina : Drawn to the ocean

210
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:28,390
Sina : Down by the shore

211
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,121
Sina : He took a canoe Moana

212
00:15:31,439 --> 00:15:33,239
Sina : He crossed the reef

213
00:15:33,625 --> 00:15:36,313
Sina : and found an unforgiving sea

214
00:15:36,360 --> 00:15:39,107
Sina : Waves like mountains

215
00:15:39,373 --> 00:15:42,330
Sina : His best friend begged to be on that boat

216
00:15:43,063 --> 00:15:44,579
Sina : Your dad couldn't save him

217
00:15:47,583 --> 00:15:50,051
Sina : He's hoping he can save you

218
00:15:52,339 --> 00:15:57,454
Sina : Sometimes who we wish we were what we wish we could do

219
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,144
Sina : it's just not meant to be

220
00:16:15,562 --> 00:16:19,776
Moana : I've been staring at the edge of the water

221
00:16:19,777 --> 00:16:23,150
Moana : Long as I can remember

222
00:16:23,151 --> 00:16:25,964
Moana : Never really knowing why

223
00:16:27,608 --> 00:16:32,083
Moana : I wish I could be the perfect daughter

224
00:16:32,084 --> 00:16:34,763
Moana : But I come back to the water

225
00:16:34,764 --> 00:16:37,583
Moana : No matter how hard I try

226
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:42,246
Moana : Every turn I take Every trail I track

227
00:16:42,247 --> 00:16:45,137
Moana : Every path I make Every road leads back

228
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:50,521
Moana : To the place I know Where I cannot go Where I long to be

229
00:16:50,586 --> 00:16:55,792
Moana : See the line where the sky meets the sea It calls me

230
00:16:55,793 --> 00:17:02,077
Moana : And no one knows How far it goes

231
00:17:02,102 --> 00:17:07,093
Moana : If the wind in my sail on the sea Stays behind me

232
00:17:07,094 --> 00:17:10,639
Moana : One day I'll know

233
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:14,524
Moana : If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

234
00:17:14,525 --> 00:17:20,832
Moana : I know everybody on this island Seems so happy on this island

235
00:17:20,833 --> 00:17:23,459
Moana : Everything is by design

236
00:17:25,606 --> 00:17:32,350
Moana : I know everybody on this island Has a role on this island

237
00:17:32,351 --> 00:17:34,956
Moana : So maybe I can roll with mine

238
00:17:36,683 --> 00:17:39,624
Moana : I can lead with pride I can make us strong

239
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:42,434
Moana : I'll be satisfied If I play along

240
00:17:42,459 --> 00:17:45,289
Moana : But the voice inside Sings a different song

241
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:48,072
Moana : What is wrong with me

242
00:17:50,959 --> 00:17:53,339
Moana : See the light as it shines on the sea

243
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:56,160
Moana : It's blinding

244
00:17:56,161 --> 00:17:58,820
Moana : But no one knows

245
00:17:58,821 --> 00:18:02,179
Moana : How deep it goes

246
00:18:02,408 --> 00:18:07,264
Moana : And it seems like it's calling out to me So come find me

247
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:10,712
Moana : And let me know

248
00:18:10,713 --> 00:18:14,064
Moana : What's beyond that line Will I cross that line

249
00:18:14,089 --> 00:18:16,387
Moana : The line where the sky meets the sea

250
00:18:16,388 --> 00:18:18,917
Moana : It calls me

251
00:18:18,918 --> 00:18:21,828
Moana : And no one knows

252
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:25,054
Moana : How far it goes

253
00:18:25,055 --> 00:18:30,162
Moana : If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me

254
00:18:30,187 --> 00:18:33,193
Moana : One day I'll know

255
00:18:33,194 --> 00:18:40,394
Moana : How far I'll go

256
00:18:40,987 --> 00:18:41,647
Moana : Whoa

257
00:18:46,120 --> 00:18:47,467
Moana : We're okay Pua

258
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:48,922
Moana : I can do this

259
00:18:50,556 --> 00:18:53,169
Moana : There's more fish beyond the reef

260
00:18:55,062 --> 00:18:57,033
Moana : There's more beyond the reef

261
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,320
Moana : Not so bad

262
00:19:16,014 --> 00:19:16,850
Moana : Pua

263
00:20:07,681 --> 00:20:10,455
Tala : Whatever just happened

264
00:20:11,148 --> 00:20:12,527
Tala : blame it on the pig

265
00:20:12,771 --> 00:20:13,873
Moana : Gramma

266
00:20:18,729 --> 00:20:20,439
Moana : Are you gonna tell Dad

267
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:24,039
Tala : I'm his mom I don't have to tell him anything

268
00:20:27,745 --> 00:20:31,158
Moana : He was right About going out there

269
00:20:34,244 --> 00:20:36,671
Moana : It's time to put my stone on the mountain

270
00:20:39,477 --> 00:20:42,160
Tala : Okay Well then head on back

271
00:20:43,357 --> 00:20:44,950
Tala : Put that stone up there

272
00:20:49,810 --> 00:20:51,440
Moana : Why aren't you trying to talk me out of it

273
00:20:51,829 --> 00:20:53,737
Tala : You said that's what you wanted

274
00:20:55,308 --> 00:20:56,352
Moana : It is

275
00:21:00,176 --> 00:21:01,590
Tala : When I die

276
00:21:02,537 --> 00:21:05,590
Tala : I'm going to come back as one of these

277
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:08,746
Tala : Or I chose the wrong tattoo

278
00:21:09,192 --> 00:21:11,028
Moana : Why are you acting weird

279
00:21:11,232 --> 00:21:14,805
Tala : I'm the village crazy lady That's my job

280
00:21:15,458 --> 00:21:18,166
Moana : If there's something you want to tell me just tell me

281
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,939
Moana : Is there something you wanna tell me

282
00:21:22,545 --> 00:21:24,886
Tala : Is there something you want to hear

283
00:21:30,141 --> 00:21:33,499
Tala : You've been told all our people's stories

284
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,359
Tala : but one

285
00:21:36,518 --> 00:21:38,215
Moana : What is this place

286
00:21:38,272 --> 00:21:42,840
Tala : Do you really think our ancestors stayed within the reef

287
00:21:51,345 --> 00:21:53,598
Tala : Ooh

288
00:21:54,531 --> 00:21:55,788
Moana : What's in there

289
00:21:56,244 --> 00:22:00,776
Tala : The answer to the question you keep asking yourself

290
00:22:01,195 --> 00:22:04,624
Tala : Who are you meant to be

291
00:22:07,220 --> 00:22:13,038
Tala : Go inside bang the drum and find out

292
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:43,830
Moana : Whoa

293

Moana : Bang the drum

295
00:24:54,985 --> 00:24:59,838
Motunui Ancestors : We read the wind and the sky When the sun is high

296
00:24:59,839 --> 00:25:04,655
Motunui Ancestors : We sail the length of the seas On the ocean breeze

297
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:10,024
Motunui Ancestors : At night we name every star We know where we are

298
00:25:10,049 --> 00:25:14,533
Motunui Ancestors : We know who we are Who we are

299
00:25:17,126 --> 00:25:19,333
Motunui Ancestors : We set a course to find

300
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:24,288
Motunui Ancestors : A brand new island everywhere we roam

301
00:25:26,378 --> 00:25:29,303
Motunui Ancestors : We keep our island in our mind

302
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:34,230
Motunui Ancestors : And when it's time to find home We know the way

303
00:25:35,663 --> 00:25:39,133
Motunui Ancestors : We are explorers reading every sign

304
00:25:39,134 --> 00:25:44,368
Motunui Ancestors : We tell the stories of our elders In a neverending chain

305
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:58,066
Motunui Ancestors : We know the way

306
00:25:59,908 --> 00:26:01,275
Moana : We were voyagers

307
00:26:02,815 --> 00:26:04,169
Moana : We were voyagers

308
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:08,022
Moana : We were voyagers We were voyagers

309
00:26:08,129 --> 00:26:10,096
Moana : We were voyagers

310
00:26:11,382 --> 00:26:12,623
Moana : Why'd we stop

311
00:26:13,856 --> 00:26:14,872
Tala : Maui

312
00:26:15,769 --> 00:26:19,476
Tala : When he stole from the mother island darkness fell

313
00:26:19,769 --> 00:26:21,516
Tala : Te Kā awoke

314
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:25,491
Tala : Monsters lurked and boats stopped coming back

315

Maui : Knowing where you are by knowing where you've been

650

655
00:52:16,089 --> 00:52:17,537
Maui : You are not a wayfinder

656
00:52:17,562 --> 00:52:20,784
Maui : You will never be a wayfinder you will never be a way...

01:10:11,581 --> 01:10:14,520
Moana : Maybe the gods found you for a reason

942
01:10:14,943 --> 01:10:18,311
Moana : Maybe the ocean brought you to them

943
01:10:18,511 --> 01:10:22,015
Moana : because it saw someone who was worthy of being saved

01:11:50,458 --> 01:11:51,012
Moana : Yeah

950
01:12:15,400 --> 01:12:17,693
Moana : Next stop Te Fiti

951
01:13:04,892 --> 01:13:05,649
Moana : What

952
01:13:05,731 --> 01:13:06,919
Maui : I figured it out

953
01:13:08,566 --> 01:13:12,138
Maui : You know the ocean used to love when I pulled up islands

954
01:13:12,825 --> 01:13:16,172
Maui : cause your ancestors would sail her seas and find em

955
01:13:17,105 --> 01:13:19,785
Maui : All those new lands new villages

956
01:13:20,438 --> 01:13:22,478
Maui : It was the water that connected em all

957
01:13:23,344 --> 01:13:24,838
Maui : And if I were the ocean

958
01:13:25,164 --> 01:13:29,271
Maui : I think I'd be looking for a curlyhaired nonprincess

959
01:13:29,991 --> 01:13:31,225
Maui : to start that again

960
01:13:31,929 --> 01:13:36,525
Moana : That is literally the nicest thing you've ever said to me

961
01:13:37,385 --> 01:13:39,678
Moana : Probably should have saved it for Te Fiti

962
01:13:40,953 --> 01:13:42,078
Maui : I did

963
01:13:45,093 --> 01:13:47,081
Maui : Moana of Motunui

964
01:13:47,139 --> 01:13:52,798
Maui : I believe you have officially delivered Maui across the great sea

965
01:13:54,333 --> 01:13:58,530
Maui : Moana Moana Moana You're so amazing

966
01:14:00,645 --> 01:14:01,658
Maui : It's time

967
01:14:20,178 --> 01:14:21,358
Moana : Go save the world

968
01:14:22,813 --> 01:14:24,752
Maui : Cheeeehoooo

969
01:14:45,204 --> 01:14:45,871
Moana : Maui

970
01:15:21,254 --> 01:15:22,263
Maui : What are you doing

971
01:15:22,288 --> 01:15:24,088
Moana : Finding you a better way in

972
01:15:25,850 --> 01:15:26,820
Maui : We won't make it

973
01:15:26,954 --> 01:15:27,694
Moana : Yes we will

974
01:15:27,860 --> 01:15:28,439
Maui : Turn around

975
01:15:28,474 --> 01:15:28,714
Moana : No

976
01:15:29,024 --> 01:15:30,116
Maui : Moana stop

977
01:15:30,117 --> 01:15:30,584
Moana : No

978
01:15:59,260 --> 01:16:00,746
Moana : Are you okay

979
01:16:02,714 --> 01:16:03,324
Moana : Maui

980
01:16:11,455 --> 01:16:12,803
Maui : I told you to turn back

981
01:16:15,552 --> 01:16:17,135
Moana : I thought we could make it

982
01:16:17,655 --> 01:16:18,555
Maui : We

983
01:16:20,228 --> 01:16:22,201
Moana : I thought I could make it

984
01:16:23,777 --> 01:16:25,312
Moana : We can fix it

985
01:16:25,407 --> 01:16:27,480
Maui : It was made by the gods

986
01:16:27,607 --> 01:16:29,487
Maui : You can't fix it

987
01:16:30,113 --> 01:16:31,679
Moana : Next time we'll be more careful

988
01:16:32,366 --> 01:16:34,249
Moana : Te Kā was stuck on the barrier islands

989
01:16:34,532 --> 01:16:36,866
Moana : It's lava it can't go in the water

990
01:16:37,085 --> 01:16:38,559
Moana : We can find a way around

991
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,212
Maui : I'm not going back

992
01:16:42,067 --> 01:16:43,887
Moana : We still have to restore the heart

993
01:16:44,173 --> 01:16:45,622
Maui : My hook is cracked

994
01:16:45,680 --> 01:16:47,526
Maui : One more hit and it's over

995
01:16:47,527 --> 01:16:49,719
Moana : Maui you have to restore the heart

996
01:16:49,774 --> 01:16:51,952
Maui : Without my hook I am nothing

997
01:16:51,953 --> 01:16:53,095
Moana : That's not true

998
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:55,324
Maui : Without my hook I am nothing

999
01:17:05,218 --> 01:17:09,365
Moana : We are only here because you stole the heart in the first place

1000
01:17:11,033 --> 01:17:15,184
Maui : No we're here because the ocean told you you're special and you believed it

1001
01:17:16,664 --> 01:17:19,464
Moana : I am Moana of Motunui

1002
01:17:19,615 --> 01:17:20,989
Moana : You will board my boat

1003
01:17:20,990 --> 01:17:21,872
Maui : Goodbye Moana

1004
01:17:21,897 --> 01:17:23,192
Moana : sail across the sea

1005
01:17:23,193 --> 01:17:25,548
Maui : I'm not killing myself so you can prove you're something you're not

1006
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:27,377
Moana : and restore the heart of Te Fiti

1007
01:17:27,812 --> 01:17:29,899
Moana : The ocean chose me

1008
01:17:31,139 --> 01:17:32,479
Maui : It chose wrong

1009
01:17:42,713 --> 01:17:43,393
Moana : Maui

1010
01:17:58,742 --> 01:18:00,476
Moana : Why did you bring me here

1011
01:18:06,011 --> 01:18:07,930
Moana : I'm not the right person

1012
01:18:10,509 --> 01:18:13,226
Moana : You have to choose someone else

1013
01:18:16,031 --> 01:18:18,538
Moana : Choose someone else

1014
01:18:18,539 --> 01:18:20,614
Moana : Please

1015
01:18:39,552 --> 01:18:40,769
Moana : No

1016
01:18:56,901 --> 01:18:59,601
Tala : You're a long ways past the reef

1017
01:19:00,428 --> 01:19:01,394
Moana : Gramma

1018
01:19:03,724 --> 01:19:06,479
Tala : Guess I chose the right tattoo

1019
01:19:07,081 --> 01:19:08,798
Moana : Gramma

1020
01:19:13,305 --> 01:19:15,637
Moana : I tried Gramma

1021
01:19:17,218 --> 01:19:19,299
Moana : I couldn't do it

1022
01:19:20,119 --> 01:19:21,867
Tala : It's not your fault

1023
01:19:22,669 --> 01:19:26,224
Tala : I never should have put so much on your shoulders

1024
01:19:27,268 --> 01:19:29,387
Tala : If you are ready to go home

1025
01:19:30,698 --> 01:19:32,317
Tala : I will be with you

1026
01:19:49,363 --> 01:19:51,041
Tala : Why do you hesitate

1027
01:19:52,251 --> 01:19:53,647
Moana : I don't know

1028
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,218
Tala : I know a girl from an island

1029
01:20:01,027 --> 01:20:03,422
Tala : She stands apart from the crowd

1030
01:20:03,862 --> 01:20:07,070
Tala : She loves the sea and her people

1031
01:20:07,071 --> 01:20:10,132
Tala : She makes her whole family proud

1032
01:20:10,455 --> 01:20:14,034
Tala : Sometimes the world seems against you

1033
01:20:14,035 --> 01:20:16,941
Tala : The journey may leave a scar

1034
01:20:17,446 --> 01:20:22,948
Tala : But scars can heal and reveal just Where you are

1035
01:20:23,847 --> 01:20:26,907
Tala : The people you love will change you

1036
01:20:26,908 --> 01:20:30,077
Tala : The things you have learned will guide you

1037
01:20:30,078 --> 01:20:33,458
Tala : And nothing on earth can silence

1038
01:20:33,459 --> 01:20:36,928
Tala : The quiet voice still inside you

1039
01:20:36,929 --> 01:20:40,314
Tala : And when that voice starts to whisper

1040
01:20:40,315 --> 01:20:43,284
Moana you've come so far

1041
01:20:43,285 --> 01:20:45,734
Tala : Moana listen

1042
01:20:45,735 --> 01:20:51,026
Tala : Do you know who you are

1043
01:20:53,034 --> 01:20:54,010
Moana : Who am I

1044
01:20:56,460 --> 01:20:59,761
Moana : I am a girl who loves my island

1045
01:20:59,762 --> 01:21:03,194
Moana : And the girl who loves the sea

1046
01:21:04,367 --> 01:21:07,314
Moana : It calls me

1047
01:21:09,514 --> 01:21:12,406
Moana : I am the daughter of the village chief

1048
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:16,124
Moana : We are descended from voyagers

1049
01:21:16,125 --> 01:21:18,662
Moana : Who found their way across the world

1050
01:21:18,663 --> 01:21:21,867
Moana : They call me

1051
01:21:22,341 --> 01:21:25,427
Moana : I've delivered us to where we are

1052
01:21:25,428 --> 01:21:28,654
Moana : I have journeyed farther

1053
01:21:28,933 --> 01:21:35,100
Moana : I am everything I've learned and more Still it calls me

1054
01:21:35,499 --> 01:21:41,001
Moana : And the call isn't out there at all It's inside me

1055
01:21:41,002 --> 01:21:47,933
Moana : It's like the tide Always falling and rising

1056
01:21:47,934 --> 01:21:53,786
Moana : I will carry you here in my heart You remind me

1057
01:21:53,787 --> 01:22:00,309
Moana : That come what may I know the way

01:22:00,334 --> 01:22:04,753
Moana : I am Moana

1059
01:22:39,396 --> 01:22:41,839
Moana : I am Moana of Motunui

1060
01:22:43,248 --> 01:22:44,319
Moana : Aboard my boat

1063
01:23:26,211 --> 01:23:28,471
Moana : Te Kā can't follow us into the water

1064
01:23:28,944 --> 01:23:30,558
Moana : We make it past the barrier islands

1065
01:23:31,269 --> 01:23:32,558
Moana : we make it to Te Fiti

1066
01:23:33,299 --> 01:23:34,495
Moana : None of which you understand

1067

Maui : I have no excuse

1109
01:31:35,630 --> 01:31:36,748
Maui : I'm sorry

1110
01:31:45,787 --> 01:31:48,840
Moana : You know it'd be rude to refuse a gift from a goddess

1111
01:31:50,409 --> 01:31:52,807
Maui : Cheeeehoooo

1112
01:31:54,360 --> 01:31:54,966
Maui : Thank you

1113
01:31:55,273 --> 01:31:57,758
Maui : Your kind gesture is deeply appreciated

1114
01:31:57,759 --> 01:31:58,819
Maui : Cheeeehoooo

1115
01:32:47,746 --> 01:32:49,260
Maui : Gonna miss you drumstick

1116
01:32:49,320 --> 01:32:50,720
Moana : You could come with us you know

1117
01:32:51,475 --> 01:32:54,881
Moana : My people are going to need a master wayfinder

1118
01:32:56,425 --> 01:32:57,941
Maui : They already have one

1119
01:33:16,720 --> 01:33:18,115
Moana : See you out there Maui

1120
01:33:18,731 --> 01:33:21,028
Maui : See you out there Moana

1121
01:33:21,922 --> 01:33:23,308
Maui : Cheeeehoooo

1122
01:34:14,545 --> 01:34:15,808
Moana : Mom Dad

1123
01:34:16,048 --> 01:34:17,193
Sina : Moana

1124
01:34:25,314 --> 01:34:29,974
Moana : I may have gone a little ways past the reef

1125
01:34:31,059 --> 01:34:32,884
Chief Tui : It suits you

1126
01:34:32,947 --> 01:34:34,095
Villager1 : She's back

1127
01:34:34,096 --> 01:34:35,281
Villager2 : Moana

1128
01:34:35,353 --> 01:34:35,965
Moana : Pua

1129
01:34:39,028 --> 01:34:39,801
Villager3 : Moana

1130
01:34:41,580 --> 01:34:42,633
Villager4 : Welcome home

1131
01:35:32,742 --> 01:35:35,080
Motunui Ancestors : We set a course to find

1132
01:35:35,222 --> 01:35:39,917
Motunui Ancestors : A brand new island everywhere we roam

1133
01:35:41,805 --> 01:35:44,800
Motunui Ancestors : We keep our island in our mind

1134
01:35:44,801 --> 01:35:49,582
Motunui Ancestors : And when it's time to find home We know the way

1135
01:35:50,669 --> 01:35:54,191
Motunui Ancestors : We are explorers reading every sign

1136
01:35:54,209 --> 01:35:59,202
Motunui Ancestors : We tell the stories of our elders In a neverending chain

1137
01:36:05,989 --> 01:36:12,415
Motunui Ancestors : We know the way

1138
01:36:19,289 --> 01:36:23,240
I've been staring at the edge of the water

1139
01:36:23,273 --> 01:36:26,013
Long as I can remember

1140
01:36:26,293 --> 01:36:29,019
Never really knowing why

1141
01:36:30,339 --> 01:36:34,393
I wish I could be the perfect daughter

1142
01:36:34,457 --> 01:36:37,168
But I come back to the water

1143
01:36:37,288 --> 01:36:40,008
No matter how hard I try

1144
01:36:41,188 --> 01:36:44,014
Every turn I take Every trail I track

1145
01:36:44,047 --> 01:36:46,801
Every path I make Every road leads back

1146
01:36:46,834 --> 01:36:49,554
To the place I know Where I cannot go

1147
01:36:49,579 --> 01:36:52,521
Where I long to be

1148
01:36:54,643 --> 01:36:57,054
See the line where the sky meets the sea

1149
01:36:57,190 --> 01:36:59,527
It calls me

1150
01:36:59,674 --> 01:37:02,387
And no one knows

1151
01:37:02,441 --> 01:37:05,374
How far it goes

1152
01:37:05,622 --> 01:37:10,260
If the wind in my sail on the sea Stays behind me

1153
01:37:10,434 --> 01:37:13,559
One day I'll know

1154
01:37:13,659 --> 01:37:17,712
If I go there's just no telling how far I'll go

1155
01:37:27,087 --> 01:37:30,945
I know everybody on this island

1156
01:37:30,970 --> 01:37:33,803
Seems so happy on this island

1157
01:37:33,847 --> 01:37:37,203
Everything is by design

1158
01:37:37,794 --> 01:37:41,495
I know everybody on this island

1159
01:37:41,662 --> 01:37:44,389
Has a role on this island

1160
01:37:44,455 --> 01:37:47,482
So maybe I can roll with mine

1161
01:37:47,815 --> 01:37:50,790
I can lead with pride I can make us strong

1162
01:37:50,815 --> 01:37:53,444
I'll be satisfied If I play along

1163
01:37:53,469 --> 01:37:56,177
But the voice inside Sings a different song

1164
01:37:56,202 --> 01:38:00,295
What is wrong with me

1165
01:38:00,464 --> 01:38:03,462
See the light as it shines on the sea

1166
01:38:03,565 --> 01:38:05,878
It's blinding

1167
01:38:05,944 --> 01:38:08,680
But no one knows

1168
01:38:08,745 --> 01:38:11,631
How deep it goes

1169
01:38:11,765 --> 01:38:13,925
And it seems like it's calling out to me

1170
01:38:13,958 --> 01:38:16,523
So come find me

1171
01:38:16,616 --> 01:38:19,436
And let me know

1172
01:38:19,656 --> 01:38:22,515
What's beyond that line Will I cross that line

1173
01:38:22,540 --> 01:38:24,615
See the line where the sky meets the sea

1174
01:38:24,704 --> 01:38:27,150
It calls me

1175
01:38:27,195 --> 01:38:29,607
And no one knows

1176
01:38:29,668 --> 01:38:32,748
How far it goes

1177
01:38:32,903 --> 01:38:37,627
If the wind in my sail on the sea stays behind me

1178
01:38:37,652 --> 01:38:40,204
One day I'll know

1179
01:38:40,237 --> 01:38:45,524
How far I'll go

1180
01:40:03,205 --> 01:40:05,199
I see what's happening Yeah

1181
01:40:06,612 --> 01:40:09,113
You're face to face with greatness and it's strange

1182
01:40:09,152 --> 01:40:11,708
You don't even know how you feel

1183
01:40:11,733 --> 01:40:12,913
It's adorable

1184
01:40:13,666 --> 01:40:16,296
It's nice to see that humans never change

1185
01:40:16,525 --> 01:40:19,786
Open your eyes Let's begin

1186
01:40:19,811 --> 01:40:23,202
Yes it's really me Breathe it in

1187
01:40:23,227 --> 01:40:24,830
I know it's a lot

1188
01:40:24,855 --> 01:40:27,026
The hair The bod

1189
01:40:27,669 --> 01:40:30,285
When you're staring at a demigod

1190
01:40:30,554 --> 01:40:32,781
So what can I say except

1191
01:40:32,810 --> 01:40:34,554
You're welcome

1192
01:40:34,579 --> 01:40:37,382
For the tides the sun the sky

1193
01:40:37,718 --> 01:40:40,128
Hey it's okay it's okay

1194
01:40:40,165 --> 01:40:41,989
You're welcome

1195
01:40:42,014 --> 01:40:44,871
I'm just an ordinary demiguy

1196
01:40:44,930 --> 01:40:48,804
What can I say except You're welcome

1197
01:40:48,829 --> 01:40:51,964
For the tides the sun the sky

1198
01:40:51,989 --> 01:40:54,258
Hey it's okay it's okay

1199
01:40:54,283 --> 01:40:56,186
You're welcome

1200
01:40:56,211 --> 01:40:58,762
I'm just an ordinary demiguy

1201
01:40:58,787 --> 01:41:00,283
Honestly I could go on and on

1202
01:41:00,308 --> 01:41:02,051
I could explain every natural phenomenon

1203
01:41:02,060 --> 01:41:05,559
The tide the grass the ground Oh that was me I was messing around

1204
01:41:05,584 --> 01:41:07,170
I killed a snake I buried its guts

1205
01:41:07,180 --> 01:41:09,048
Sprouted a tree Now you got coconuts

1206
01:41:09,073 --> 01:41:10,868
What's the lesson What is the take away

1207
01:41:10,893 --> 01:41:12,772
Don't mess with Maui when he's on a breakaway

1208
01:41:12,797 --> 01:41:15,974
And the tapestry here on my skin Is a map of the victories I win

1209
01:41:16,019 --> 01:41:17,849
Look where I've been I make everything happen

1210
01:41:17,894 --> 01:41:20,087
Look at that Mean MiniMaui just tickety tappin

1211
01:41:20,112 --> 01:41:21,197
Singing and scratchin

1212
01:41:21,222 --> 01:41:23,677
Flipping and snappin People are clappin hearing me rap

1213
01:41:23,702 --> 01:41:25,696
Bring the chorus back in

1214
01:41:25,721 --> 01:41:30,005
Well anyway let me say You're welcome

1215
01:41:30,030 --> 01:41:32,927

Hey it's okay it's okay You're welcome

1218
01:41:40,099 --> 01:41:44,360
Hey it's your day to say You're welcome

1219
01:41:44,369 --> 01:41:47,144
Cause I'm gonna need that boat

1220
01:41:47,169 --> 01:41:51,315
I'm sailing away away You're welcome

1221
01:41:51,340 --> 01:41:54,387

I'm so shiny

1226
01:46:10,371 --> 01:46:12,399
Didn't help me though did it

1227
01:46:12,643 --> 01:46:14,359
Still upside down here

1228
01:46:14,739 --> 01:46:16,939
Just need a little push

1229
01:46:19,262 --> 01:46:20,321
Can we be real

1230
01:46:20,352 --> 01:46:23,789
If my name was Sebastian and I had a cool Jamaican accent

1231
01:46:23,797 --> 01:46:25,191
you'd totally help me

1232
01:46:25,272 --> 01:46:26,872
You would You know you would
