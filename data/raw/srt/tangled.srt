1
00:00:52,768 --> 00:00:56,368
Flynn : This is the story of how I died

2
00:00:57,817 --> 00:01:02,435
Flynn : But don't worry this is a fun story and the truth is it isn't even mine

3
00:01:02,445 --> 00:01:05,521
Flynn : This is the story of a girl named Rapunzel

4
00:01:06,302 --> 00:01:09,233
Flynn : And it starts with the sun

5
00:01:10,605 --> 00:01:15,328
Flynn : Once upon a time a single drop of sunlight fell from the heavens

6
00:01:15,726 --> 00:01:21,419
Flynn : And from this small drop of sun grew a magic golden flower

7
00:01:22,193 --> 00:01:25,299
Flynn : It had the ability to heal the sick and injured

8
00:01:26,809 --> 00:01:28,993
Flynn : Oh you see that old woman over there

9
00:01:29,017 --> 00:01:30,405
Flynn : You might want to remember her

10
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:32,158
Flynn : She's kind of important

11
00:01:33,249 --> 00:01:37,929
Flynn : Centuries passed and a hop skip and a boat ride away there grew a kingdom

12
00:01:38,662 --> 00:01:41,162
Flynn : The kingdom was ruled by a beloved king and queen

13
00:01:42,774 --> 00:01:45,299
Flynn : And the queen was about to have a baby

14
00:01:46,179 --> 00:01:47,209
Flynn : But she got sick

15
00:01:48,353 --> 00:01:49,559
Flynn : Really sick

16
00:01:50,022 --> 00:01:53,718
Flynn : She was running out of time and that's when people start to look for a miracle

17
00:01:54,499 --> 00:01:57,238
Flynn : Or in this case a magic golden flower

18
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,920
Flynn : Ah I told you she'd be important

19
00:02:01,125 --> 00:02:03,373
Flynn : Instead of sharing the sun's gift

20
00:02:03,618 --> 00:02:09,482
Flynn : this woman Mother Gothel hoarded its healing power and used it to keep herself young for hundreds of years

21
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:13,317
Flynn : And all she had to do was sing a special song

22
00:02:13,822 --> 00:02:17,995
Gothel : Flower gleam and glow

23
00:02:18,436 --> 00:02:21,679
Gothel : Let your power shine

24
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,499
Gothel : Make the clock reverse

25
00:02:25,580 --> 00:02:29,285
Gothel : Bring back what once was mine

26
00:02:29,615 --> 00:02:33,231
Gothel : What once was mine

27
00:02:33,232 --> 00:02:36,385
Flynn : Alright You get the gist She sings to it she turns young Creepy right

28
00:02:48,231 --> 00:02:49,360
Soldiers : We found it

29
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:58,871
Flynn : The magic of the golden flower healed the queen

30
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,410
Flynn : A healthy baby girl a princess was born with beautiful golden hair

31
00:03:14,994 --> 00:03:17,614
Flynn : I'll give you a hint that's Rapunzel

32
00:03:19,401 --> 00:03:24,273
Flynn : To celebrate her birth the king and queen launched a flying lantern into the sky

33
00:03:29,266 --> 00:03:32,628
Flynn : And for that one moment everything was perfect

34
00:03:35,633 --> 00:03:37,334
Flynn : And then that moment ended

35
00:03:38,941 --> 00:03:43,633
Gothel : Flower gleam and glow

36
00:03:45,014 --> 00:03:48,221
Gothel : Let your power shine

37
00:03:49,115 --> 00:03:51,026
Gothel : Make the clock re...

38
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,126
Flynn : Gothel broke into the castle stole the child and just like that gone

39
00:04:04,455 --> 00:04:07,729
Flynn : The kingdom searched and searched but they could not find the princess

40
00:04:08,344 --> 00:04:10,923
Flynn : For deep within the forest in a hidden tower

41
00:04:11,624 --> 00:04:13,147
Flynn : Gothel raised the child as her own

42
00:04:13,172 --> 00:04:15,983
Baby Rapunzel : Save what has been lost

43
00:04:16,327 --> 00:04:19,740
Baby Rapunzel : Bring back what once was mine

44
00:04:19,948 --> 00:04:22,956
Baby Rapunzel : What once was mine

45
00:04:22,957 --> 00:04:24,920
Flynn : Gothel had found her new magic flower

46
00:04:25,455 --> 00:04:28,420
Flynn : but this time she was determined to keep it hidden

47
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:31,007
Baby Rapunzel : Why can't I go outside

48
00:04:31,447 --> 00:04:36,444
Gothel : The outside world is a dangerous place filled with horrible selfish people

49
00:04:36,622 --> 00:04:39,622
Gothel : You must stay here where you're safe

50
00:04:39,726 --> 00:04:41,386
Gothel : Do you understand flower

51
00:04:41,483 --> 00:04:42,598
Baby Rapunzel : Yes Mommy

52
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:49,122
Flynn : But the walls of that tower could not hide everything

53
00:04:54,182 --> 00:04:58,823
Flynn : Each year on her birthday the king and queen released thousands of lanterns into the sky

54
00:04:59,347 --> 00:05:04,564
Flynn : in hope that one day their lost princess would return

55
00:05:22,971 --> 00:05:24,579

625
00:53:00,620 --> 00:53:03,823
Rapunzel : Save what has been lost

Flynn : I'm not freaking out Are you freaking out

630
00:53:34,238 --> 00:53:39,527

631
00:53:41,597 --> 00:53:43,427
Rapunzel : Forever I guess

632
00:53:44,640 --> 00:53:47,767
Rapunzel : Mother says when I was a baby people tried to cut it

633
00:53:48,116 --> 00:53:49,995
Rapunzel : They wanted to take it for themselves

634
00:53:50,550 --> 00:53:55,235
Rapunzel : But once it's cut it turns brown and loses its power

635
00:53:56,320 --> 00:53:59,725
Rapunzel : A gift like that it has to be protected

636
00:54:00,681 --> 00:54:02,343
Rapunzel : That's why Mother never let me

637

Rapunzel : Yes.

642
00:54:25,471 --> 00:54:26,907
Rapunzel : It's complicated

643
00:54:37,876 --> 00:54:41,076
Rapunzel : So, Eugene Fitzherbert, huh?

644

Flynn : Ah yeah Well

645
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:49,593
Flynn : I'll spare you the sob story of poor orphan Eugene Fitzherbert It's a little bit of a It's a little bit of a downer

646
00:54:55,988 --> 00:55:01,836
Flynn : There was this book I used to read every night to all the younger kids The Tales of Flynnagan Rider

647
00:55:01,830 --> 00:55:06,699
Flynn : Swashbuckling rogue richest man alive not bad with the ladies either

648
00:55:06,699 --> 00:55:08,621
Flynn : Not that he'd ever brag about it of course

649
00:55:09,735 --> 00:55:10,926
Rapunzel : Was he a thief too

650

Flynn : Well no

652
00:55:16,446 --> 00:55:20,084
Flynn : He had enough money to do anything that he wanted to do He could go anywhere that he wanted to go

653
00:55:20,510 --> 00:55:24,695
Flynn : And for a kid with nothing, I don't know, I…

654
00:55:26,277 --> 00:55:27,719
Flynn : Just seemed like the better option

655
00:55:29,208 --> 00:55:31,659
Flynn : You can't tell anyone about this okay

656
00:55:32,243 --> 00:55:34,022
Flynn : It could ruin my whole reputation

657
00:55:34,105 --> 00:55:37,044
Rapunzel : Ah We wouldn't want that

658
00:55:37,069 --> 00:55:39,473
Flynn : A fake reputation is all a man has

659
00:55:47,707 --> 00:55:49,316
Flynn : Well I should um

660

Flynn : I should get some more firewood

Rapunzel : Hey

662
00:55:55,720 --> 00:56:00,867
Rapunzel : For the record, I like Eugene Fitzherbert much better than Flynn Rider.

663
00:56:03,052 --> 00:56:07,527
Flynn : Well Then you'd be the first. But thank you.

664
