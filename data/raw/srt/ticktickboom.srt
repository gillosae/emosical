Jonathan Larson : Once a week we would gather the few surviving members of our dwindling tribe

468
00:27:26,121 --> 00:27:30,672
Jonathan Larson : We would watch one of us present what we'd been working on to a panel of well

469
00:27:32,391 --> 00:27:33,356
Jonathan Larson : real writers

470

00:28:02,481 --> 00:28:03,588
Jonathan Larson : Is it really him

475
00:28:05,268 --> 00:28:06,355
Jonathan Larson : It was

476
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:11,846
Jonathan Larson : Stephen Sondheim

477
00:28:16,840 --> 00:28:18,313
Walter Bloom : All right I'll start

478
00:28:19,787 --> 00:28:20,823
Walter Bloom : I'm lost

479
00:28:21,553 --> 00:28:23,870
Walter Bloom : I I don't know what the show is

480
00:28:23,871 --> 00:28:25,667
Walter Bloom : Is it social commentary

481
00:28:25,691 --> 00:28:30,338
Walter Bloom : Is it science fiction And the music is the same thing Is it rock Is it Broadway Is it both

482
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,886
Walter Bloom : Is it neither Steve what did you think

483
00:28:36,379 --> 00:28:39,857
Stephen Sondheim : I have to say I disagree pretty strongly Walter

484
00:28:39,882 --> 00:28:42,996
Stephen Sondheim : I think this is a musical that knows exactly what it is

485
00:28:44,479 --> 00:28:46,920
Walter Bloom : Yes Yes Of course yes Abso

486
00:28:46,956 --> 00:28:50,293
Stephen Sondheim : The world that you've created is really original

487
00:28:50,294 --> 00:28:51,695
Stephen Sondheim : It's fascinating

488
00:28:51,696 --> 00:28:56,090
Stephen Sondheim : The problem is it's not particularly easy to follow the

489
00:28:56,114 --> 00:29:01,547
Stephen Sondheim : emotional thread The details distract us from connecting with the characters

490
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:02,778
Stephen Sondheim : Does that make sense

491
00:29:02,802 --> 00:29:03,440
Jonathan Larson : Okay Okay

492
00:29:03,465 --> 00:29:06,412
Walter Bloom : Yes yes We're on the same page That's exactly how I felt

493
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:09,587
Walter Bloom : We're saying the same thing just differently

494
00:29:09,588 --> 00:29:12,976
Walter Bloom : But the music okay I'm sorry The music just wasn't there

495
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:15,224
Stephen Sondheim : I actually I thought the songs were swell

496
00:29:15,694 --> 00:29:17,864
Walter Bloom : Yeah okay Yes Yes

497
00:29:17,882 --> 00:29:19,591
Walter Bloom : The individual songs

498
00:29:19,623 --> 00:29:23,948
Stephen Sondheim : I particularly like the one the young man sings at the end of the first act

499
00:29:23,949 --> 00:29:27,375
Stephen Sondheim : First rate lyric and tune Well done

500
00:29:29,151 --> 00:29:32,590
Jonathan Larson : First rate lyric and tune

00:29:32,591 --> 00:29:33,098
Jonathan Larson : Thank you

502
00:29:33,238 --> 00:29:38,781
Jonathan Larson : Those five words were enough to keep me going for the next two years

503
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:44,471
Stephen Sondheim : You're missing a song for the young woman Uh

504
00:29:44,611 --> 00:29:45,386
Jonathan Larson : Elizabeth

505
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:48,501
Stephen Sondheim : Elizabeth It's the turning point in the show

506
00:29:48,573 --> 00:29:52,249
Stephen Sondheim : Your protagonist is either gonna go in this direction or that direction

507
00:29:52,269 --> 00:29:55,429
Stephen Sondheim : Someone has to wake him up shake some sense into him

508
00:29:56,155 --> 00:29:56,742
Jonathan Larson : Okay

509
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:01,522
Walter Bloom : It's so funny because I was gonna say the exact same thing

510
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:06,342
Jonathan Larson : Can we talk musicians Because if it's only gonna be four

511
00:30:06,642 --> 00:30:10,313
Jonathan Larson : then I gotta figure out how I'm gonna split up the bass parts

512
00:30:10,314 --> 00:30:11,922

Jonathan Larson;Susan : Cages or wings

1712
01:49:03,664 --> 01:49:05,923
Jonathan Larson;Susan : Which do you prefer

1713
01:49:06,210 --> 01:49:10,458
Jonathan Larson;Susan;Michael : Ask the birds

1714
01:49:10,459 --> 01:49:14,939
Jonathan Larson;Susan;Michael : Fear or love baby Don't say the answer

1715
01:49:14,988 --> 01:49:17,226
Jonathan Larson : Actions speak louder

1716
01:49:17,220 --> 01:49:19,881
Susan;Michael : Louder than louder than

1717
01:49:19,882 --> 01:49:22,228
Jonathan Larson;Susan;Michael : They speak louder

1718
01:49:22,253 --> 01:49:24,746
Susan;Michael : Louder than louder than

1719
01:49:24,747 --> 01:49:30,045
Jonathan Larson;Susan;Michael : Actions speak louder than

1720
01:49:55,591 --> 01:49:56,864
Michael : Make a wish

1721
01:50:26,814 --> 01:50:30,165
You're on the air

1722
01:50:31,381 --> 01:50:35,916
I'm underground

1723
01:50:36,476 --> 01:50:41,169
Signal's fading

1724
01:50:41,550 --> 01:50:45,706
Can't be found

1725
01:50:46,090 --> 01:50:51,417
I finally open up

1726
01:50:51,426 --> 01:50:56,582
For you I would do anything

1727
01:50:56,592 --> 01:51:00,916
But you've turned off the volume

1728
01:51:01,300 --> 01:51:08,507
Just when I've begun to sing

1729
01:51:09,640 --> 01:51:11,714
Come to your senses

1730
01:51:11,717 --> 01:51:15,208
Defenses are not the way to go

1731
01:51:15,217 --> 01:51:19,978
And you know Or at least you knew

1732
01:51:19,967 --> 01:51:22,875
Everything's strange you've changed

1733
01:51:22,885 --> 01:51:27,041
And I don't know what to do To get through

1734
01:51:27,051 --> 01:51:34,125
I don't know what to do

1735
01:51:35,716 --> 01:51:38,504
I have to laugh

1736
01:51:39,843 --> 01:51:44,429
You sure put on a show

1737
01:51:45,300 --> 01:51:50,255
Love is passé in this day and age

1738
01:51:50,217 --> 01:51:55,070
How can we expect it to grow

1739
01:51:55,615 --> 01:52:00,375
You as the knight

1740
01:52:00,841 --> 01:52:04,632
Me as the queen

1741
01:52:05,717 --> 01:52:10,447
All I've got tonight

1742
01:52:10,426 --> 01:52:17,500
Is static on a screen

1743
01:52:18,382 --> 01:52:20,533
Come to your senses

1744
01:52:20,510 --> 01:52:24,239
The fences inside are not for real

1745
01:52:24,176 --> 01:52:28,947
If we feel as we did and I do

1746
01:52:28,885 --> 01:52:32,905
Can't you recall when this all began

1747
01:52:32,842 --> 01:52:35,590
It was only you and me

1748
01:52:35,592 --> 01:52:40,854
It was only me and you

1749
01:52:45,277 --> 01:52:52,145
But now the air is Filled with confusion

1750
01:52:55,052 --> 01:53:02,255
We replace care with illusion

1751
01:53:04,599 --> 01:53:09,424
How come it's cool to be cold

1752
01:53:09,424 --> 01:53:13,675
When nothing lasts anymore

1753
01:53:14,300 --> 01:53:18,879
When love becomes disposable

1754
01:53:18,885 --> 01:53:25,167
This is the shape of things We cannot ignore

1755
01:53:28,590 --> 01:53:32,836
Come to your senses Suspense is fine

1756
01:53:32,842 --> 01:53:35,413
If you're just an empty image

1757
01:53:35,385 --> 01:53:39,114
Emanating out of a screen

1758
01:53:39,051 --> 01:53:42,760
Baby be real you can feel again

1759
01:53:42,760 --> 01:53:46,499
You don't need a music box melody

1760
01:53:46,426 --> 01:53:50,083
To know what I mean

1761
01:53:50,092 --> 01:53:53,840
So come to your senses

1762
01:53:55,317 --> 01:54:00,473
Will you come to your senses

1763
01:54:00,467 --> 01:54:05,808
Yeah come to your senses

1764
01:54:05,801 --> 01:54:11,666
Come to your senses

1765
01:54:36,152 --> 01:54:39,315
Deep dark velvet hugs your silhouette

1766
01:54:39,301 --> 01:54:42,550
Black silk stockings you're my Juliet

1767
01:54:42,551 --> 01:54:45,802
Soft long hair Baby beautiful blue eyes

1768
01:54:45,801 --> 01:54:48,920
Cool me down before I jump Into your thighs

1769
01:54:48,926 --> 01:54:51,913
The green green dress Twenty buttons and a strap

1770
01:54:51,842 --> 01:54:55,707
The green green dress What a pleasure to unwrap

1771
01:54:55,717 --> 01:54:58,905
Green dress oh what it can do

1772
01:54:58,842 --> 01:55:04,003
What the green green dress Does to me on you

1773

Me on you

1774
01:55:14,124 --> 01:55:17,364
Let's find a chair Where we can sit and talk

1775
01:55:17,301 --> 01:55:20,527
Or get some fresh air Maybe we could take a walk

1776
01:55:20,510 --> 01:55:23,700
Tell me what you're thinkin Talk about your day

1777

Can I hear you laugh babe Can you make me smile

I'll forget what's on my mind For a while

1785
01:55:52,051 --> 01:55:54,959
Can I tie you up love If you tell me yes

Almost missed this one he said I stared at the honkytonk piano

Sure beats living in town The beach is a half a mile away

1803
01:57:20,697 --> 01:57:26,521
Not much of the cat I said He stared down underneath the couch

1804
01:57:27,126 --> 01:57:31,684
It doesn't matter much to me Not gonna beat it anyway

1805
01:57:33,266 --> 01:57:39,111
It only takes a few cents more To go first class

01:57:39,275 --> 01:57:43,415
First class only takes a few
