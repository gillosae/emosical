Sultan : If anyone can help, it's you.

206
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,608
Jafar : But it would require the use of the mystic blue diamond.

207
00:15:17,746 --> 00:15:22,792
Sultan : Oh. Uh, my ring? But it's been in the family for years.

208
00:15:22,793 --> 00:15:25,809
Jafar : It is necessary to find the princess a suitor.

209

Jafar : Don't worry.

210

Jafar : Calm yourself, Iago.

Jafar : Soon I will be sultan, not that addlepated twit.

314
00:21:28,416 --> 00:21:30,760
Aladdin : Wow. The palace looks pretty amazing, huh?

315
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:33,711
Jasmine : Oh, it's wonderful.

316
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:39,033
Aladdin : I wonder what it would be like to live there, and have servants and valets.

317
00:21:39,166 --> 00:21:42,593
Jasmine : Oh, sure. People who tell you where to go and how to dress.

318
00:21:44,133 --> 00:21:48,160
Aladdin : It's better than here. You're always scraping for food and ducking the guards.

319
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:50,545
Jasmine : You're not free to make your own choices.

320
00:21:50,546 --> 00:21:51,730
Aladdin : Sometimes you feel so...

321
00:21:51,731 --> 00:21:52,736
Jasmine : You're just...

Aladdin : (CLEARS THROAT) So, where are you from?

324
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:07,149
Jasmine : What does it matter? I ran away and I am not going back.

325
00:22:07,873 --> 00:22:09,791
Aladdin : Really? How come?

326
00:22:09,792 --> 00:22:12,459
Abu : Why, you...

327
00:22:13,013 --> 00:22:15,593
Jasmine : My father's forcing me to get married.

328
00:22:15,853 --> 00:22:18,820
Aladdin : That's... That's awful.

329

Jasmine : What?

332
00:22:25,793 --> 00:22:29,433
Aladdin : Abu says, uh, that's not fair.

333
00:22:29,602 --> 00:22:30,287
Abu : What?

334
00:22:30,347 --> 00:22:31,420
Jasmine : Oh, did he?

335
00:22:31,527 --> 00:22:33,300
Aladdin : Yeah, of course.

336
00:22:33,301 --> 00:22:37,041
Jasmine : And does Abu have anything else to say?

337
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,328
Aladdin : Well, uh, he wishes there was something he could do to help.

338
00:22:40,448 --> 00:22:42,280
Abu : Oh, boy.

Aladdin;Jasmine : They're after me! They're after you?

343
00:22:53,983 --> 00:22:55,415
Aladdin : My father
must have sent them...

344
00:22:55,416 --> 00:22:56,134
Aladdin : Do you trust me?

345
00:22:56,135 --> 00:22:56,579
Jasmine : What?

346
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,493
Aladdin : Do you trust me?

347
00:22:58,354 --> 00:22:59,361
Jasmine : Yes...

348
00:22:59,466 --> 00:23:00,653
Aladdin : Then jump!

349
00:23:06,313 --> 00:23:10,819
Soldier : We just keep running into each other, don't we, street rat?

350
00:23:11,764 --> 00:23:14,096
Aladdin : Run! Go! Get out of here!

351
00:23:14,097 --> 00:23:15,800
Soldier : Get this thing off of me!

352

Jasmine : Let him go.

355
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:24,373
Soldier : Looky here, men. A street mouse.

356
00:23:25,763 --> 00:23:29,942
Jasmine : Unhand him, by order of the princess.

357
00:23:30,760 --> 00:23:32,346
Soldier : Princess Jasmine.

358
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,466
Aladdin : The princess?

359
00:23:33,490 --> 00:23:34,400
Abu : Princess?

360
00:23:34,481 --> 00:23:37,721
Soldier : What are you doing outside the palace? And with this street rat.

361
00:23:37,746 --> 00:23:41,035
Jasmine : That's not your concern. Do as I command. Release him.

362
00:23:41,115 --> 00:23:45,568
Soldier : I would, Princess, except my orders come from Jafar.

363
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:47,243
Soldier : You'll have to take it up with him.

364
00:23:47,268 --> 00:23:49,120
Jasmine : Believe me, I will.

365
00:23:56,126 --> 00:23:56,886
Jasmine : Jafar?

366
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,460
Jafar : Oh, Princess.

367
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:02,040
Iago : Awk! Jafar, I'm stuck.

368
00:24:02,193 --> 00:24:04,396
Jafar : How may I be of service to you?

369
00:24:04,397 --> 00:24:07,877
Jasmine : The guards just took a boy from the market, on your orders.

370
00:24:08,588 --> 00:24:13,475
Jafar : Your father has charged me with keeping peace in Agrabah. The boy was a criminal.

371
00:24:13,500 --> 00:24:14,773
Jasmine : What was his crime?

372
00:24:14,930 --> 00:24:16,255
Iago : I can't breathe, Jafar.

373
00:24:16,256 --> 00:24:19,898
Jafar : Why, kidnapping the princess, of course.

374
00:24:19,923 --> 00:24:21,880
Iago : If you could just... Aah! That hurt!

375
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:24,863
Jasmine : He didn't kidnap me. I ran away.

376
00:24:24,864 --> 00:24:27,384
Jafar : Oh, dear.

377
00:24:28,173 --> 00:24:32,213
Jafar : Oh, how frightfully upsetting. Had I but known...

378
00:24:32,400 --> 00:24:33,560
Jasmine : What do you mean?

379
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,894
Jafar : Sadly, the boy's sentence has already been carried out.

380
00:24:37,533 --> 00:24:38,660
Jasmine : What sentence?

381
00:24:39,286 --> 00:24:40,121

Jasmine : I didn't even know his name.

395

Aladdin : She was the princess. I can't believe it.

396
00:25:53,066 --> 00:25:55,481
Aladdin : I must have sounded so stupid to her.

397
00:25:55,506 --> 00:25:59,706
Abu : Yoo-hoo! Aladdin! Hello!

398

Abu : Yeah, yeah, yeah.

404
00:26:18,993 --> 00:26:24,333
Aladdin : Don't worry, Abu. I'll never see her again. I'm a street rat, remember? And there's a law.

405
00:26:25,151 --> 00:26:26,823
Aladdin : She's gotta marry a prince.

Aladdin : Who are you?

411
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,160
Disguised Jafar : A lowly prisoner, like yourself.

412

Aladdin : Why would you share all of this wonderful treasure with me?

422
00:27:17,294 --> 00:27:21,720
Disguised Jafar : I need a young pair of legs and a strong back to go in after it.

423

Aladdin : Uh, one problem.

Aladdin : No way.

852
00:54:46,503 --> 00:54:50,560
Aladdin : If Jasmine found out I was really some crummy street rat,

853
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,026
Aladdin : she'd laugh at me.

854
00:54:52,079 --> 00:54:54,336
Genie : A woman appreciates a man who can make her laugh.

855
00:54:55,720 --> 00:55:00,386
Genie : Al, all joking aside, you really ought to be yourself.

856

Aladdin : Hey, that's the last thing I wanna be.

857
00:55:02,400 --> 00:55:04,240
Aladdin : Okay, I'm gonna go see her.

858
00:55:04,320 --> 00:55:08,908

Aladdin : The marketplace? I have servants who go to the marketplace for me.

877
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:14,605
Aladdin : Why, I even have servants who go to the marketplace for my servants, so it couldn't have been me you met.

878
00:56:15,614 --> 00:56:18,880
Jasmine : No. I guess not.

879
00:56:19,120 --> 00:56:21,540
Genie : Enough about you, Casanova. Talk about her.

880
00:56:21,541 --> 00:56:21,976
