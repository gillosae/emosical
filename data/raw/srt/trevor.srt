00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:15,940
Trevor : She wears a flannel navy nightgown with long sleeves I've seen it

159
00:08:16,026 --> 00:08:16,825
Walter : Lucky

160
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:18,665

161
00:08:20,961 --> 00:08:22,629
Walter : Whoa Get over here

162
00:08:22,637 --> 00:08:23,522
Trevor : It's not fair

163
00:08:23,735 --> 00:08:26,852
Trevor : Why is Mrs Kerr in charge of putting together the talent show

164
00:08:26,909 --> 00:08:29,046
Trevor : She can't even put together an outfit

165
00:08:29,922 --> 00:08:30,626
Trevor : You know

166
00:08:30,873 --> 00:08:32,588

167
00:08:32,857 --> 00:08:35,580
Walter : Especially that green dress with the loose button

168
00:08:36,872 --> 00:08:38,280
Trevor : Okay

169
00:08:39,417 --> 00:08:41,206
Walter : Would you just look at this already

170
00:08:44,255 --> 00:08:46,003

171
00:08:46,004 --> 00:08:47,404
Walter : Here Your turn

172
00:08:47,425 --> 00:08:49,999

173
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,749
Walter : It's a scientific experiment

174
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,683
Walter : You can't learn anything from just one specimen

175
00:08:53,927 --> 00:08:54,930
Walter : You're the second variable

176
00:08:54,931 --> 00:08:56,455
Trevor : What are we learning again

177
00:08:56,461 --> 00:09:00,112
Walter : I'm working on a hypothesis that mine are abnormally strong

178
00:09:00,113 --> 00:09:02,170
Walter : Like top10 strong

179
00:09:02,893 --> 00:09:05,162
Walter : But given that I have limited data

180
00:09:05,162 --> 00:09:08,497
Walter : my adjusted hypothesis is that mine are just way stronger than yours

181
00:09:08,498 --> 00:09:09,997
Trevor;Walter : No they're not Prove it

182
00:09:11,818 --> 00:09:13,139
Trevor : Is it true it can make me go deaf

183
00:09:13,149 --> 00:09:13,616
Walter : No

184
00:09:15,251 --> 00:09:16,465
Walter : Trust me

185
00:09:18,181 --> 00:09:20,012
Trevor : Do I need to use the same girl as you

186
00:09:20,013 --> 00:09:22,650
Walter : Look I was very happy with my choice

187
00:09:22,653 --> 00:09:24,267
Walter : You should be equally happy with yours

188
00:09:25,476 --> 00:09:26,139
Trevor : Right

189
00:09:27,234 --> 00:09:27,967
Trevor : Okay

190
00:09:31,679 --> 00:09:35,719
Trevor : She's got nice eyes They go with her bra

191
00:09:35,719 --> 00:09:36,560
Walter : Okay

192
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:42,178
Trevor : And with that strap across her thighs

193
00:09:42,179 --> 00:09:42,676
Walter : I guess

194
00:09:42,677 --> 00:09:45,358
Trevor : But wouldn't it itch Sitting on straw

195
00:09:45,359 --> 00:09:46,456
Walter : She's in a barn

196
00:09:48,051 --> 00:09:50,420
Trevor : That seems a little unwise

197
00:09:50,421 --> 00:09:51,214
Walter : So what

198
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:53,380
Trevor : Walter I don't want a girl who isn't smart

199
00:09:53,381 --> 00:09:59,252
Walter : Trevor you realize it's not about hay Or if her bra goes with her eyes

200
00:09:59,253 --> 00:10:00,222
Trevor : I was kidding

201
00:10:00,469 --> 00:10:01,653

Walter : She's not here to stay

204
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:04,404
Trevor : She's not even naked

205

Trevor : But the music's gonna tell ya Each and every step to take

Trevor : But then why did he

579

1056
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:26,028
Pinky : You're not like anyone else I know

1057

Pinky : I don't know

1060
00:51:32,251 --> 00:51:36,259
Pinky : But not afraid just to let it show

1061
00:51:38,258 --> 00:51:41,031
Pinky : And I could never do that

1062
00:51:42,999 --> 00:51:48,564
Pinky : With everyone always telling me

1063

Pinky : Who I should be

1064
00:51:55,499 --> 00:52:02,868
Pinky : But when I'm talking to you I'm never thinking of that stuff

1065
00:52:03,339 --> 00:52:05,273
Pinky : It's like I'm like

Pinky : But somehow I'm always good enough

1068
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:17,826
Pinky : Cause even when I sound dumb Or I don't play along

1069
00:52:17,827 --> 00:52:22,822
Pinky : You look at me And it's like you see

00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,389
Pinky : And I don't know who that is yet

1072
00:52:29,821 --> 00:52:33,363
Pinky : I didn't know I could even know

1073
00:52:33,944 --> 00:52:38,390

1407
01:10:25,744 --> 01:10:27,486
Father Joe : Do you understand what that is

1408
01:10:27,487 --> 01:10:29,108
Trevor : It wasn't until that moment

1409
01:10:30,651 --> 01:10:33,318
Trevor : and halfway through my salivawarm holy water

1410
01:10:34,005 --> 01:10:38,358
Trevor : that I realized the purpose of this miserable setup between my mom and Father Joe

1411
01:10:38,410 --> 01:10:41,896
Father Joe : Trevor did you ever have any desires

1412
01:10:41,897 --> 01:10:45,746
Father Joe : and I'm talking about sexual desires

1413
01:10:46,459 --> 01:10:47,861
Father Joe : for another boy

1414
01:10:48,743 --> 01:10:49,950
Father Joe : Be honest with me

1415
01:10:50,342 --> 01:10:52,240
Father Joe : I can help you if you're honest with me

1416
01:10:52,361 --> 01:10:56,989
Father Joe : Did you ever for example ever want to touch another boy

1417
01:10:56,990 --> 01:11:00,349
Father Joe : Like and I don't mean to suggest anything here

1418
01:11:00,350 --> 01:11:03,101
Father Joe : but like Pinky Farraday

1419
01:11:03,101 --> 01:11:03,476
Trevor : What

1420
01:11:04,207 --> 01:11:06,557
Trevor : No he's just

1421
01:11:08,085 --> 01:11:09,893
Trevor : He's the kind of person that makes me

1422
01:11:10,988 --> 01:11:16,480
Trevor : and everyone feel you know really happy

1423
01:11:18,051 --> 01:11:20,365
Trevor : So happy that you think about him all the time

1424
01:11:20,373 --> 01:11:23,667
Trevor : Like an older brother you never had

1425
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:29,965
Trevor : And you write about him in your notebook because he makes you so happy that you can't keep it inside

1426
01:11:29,966 --> 01:11:32,631
Trevor : And you just want to be sure it's going to be like this forever

1427
01:11:37,121 --> 01:11:38,715
Trevor : That happens with friends sometimes

1428
01:11:39,716 --> 01:11:40,144
Trevor : Right

1429
01:11:41,883 --> 01:11:47,589
Father Joe : Well Trevor friends are people who make us happy yes

1430
01:11:47,694 --> 01:11:50,229
Father Joe : But just in our hearts

1431
01:11:50,230 --> 01:11:51,924
Father Joe : And not well

1432
01:11:52,600 --> 01:11:55,700
Father Joe : in certain other places

1433
01:11:55,701 --> 01:12:01,657
Father Joe : Because if anyone's making you happy there well then that's not happy like a friend

1434
01:12:01,736 --> 01:12:06,222
Father Joe : But if it's anywhere else then well yes That's a friend

1435
01:12:06,337 --> 01:12:07,394
Father Joe : Probably

1436
01:12:08,775 --> 01:12:11,242
Father Joe : But if not

1437
01:12:11,931 --> 01:12:12,850
Father Joe : No

1438
01:12:14,271 --> 01:12:15,364
Father Joe : Make sense

1439
01:12:17,579 --> 01:12:18,403
Trevor : Yes

1440
01:12:19,017 --> 01:12:20,142
Trevor : Definitely

1441
01:12:21,485 --> 01:12:22,083
Trevor : Thank you

1442
01:12:29,583 --> 01:12:30,769
Trevor : That was weird

1443
01:12:32,018 --> 01:12:34,861
Trevor : In every way it could be Really weird

1444
01:12:35,839 --> 01:12:38,037
Trevor : Like I'm not who I should be

1445
01:12:38,038 --> 01:12:39,705
Trevor : But the more I play along

1446
01:12:39,706 --> 01:12:43,786
Trevor : The more somebody's telling me I'm doing something wrong

1447
01:12:43,779 --> 01:12:47,228
Trevor : Something weird

1448
01:12:47,229 --> 01:12:47,849

01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:53,317
Cathy : Did you want a milkshake It was a mistake so it's free

1451
01:12:53,414 --> 01:12:55,182
Trevor : No thanks

1452
01:12:55,314 --> 01:12:57,689
Cathy : I couldn't find you after the show yesterday

1453
01:12:58,576 --> 01:12:59,716

Cathy : Um but probably not as bad as you thought it was

1458
01:13:09,171 --> 01:13:11,913
Cathy : I bet most people don't even believe it

1459
01:13:12,962 --> 01:13:13,561

01:37:33,379 --> 01:37:34,187
Trevor : I don't think so

1880
01:37:36,833 --> 01:37:39,505
Trevor : It's just that'll always be Diana Ross

1881
01:37:39,602 --> 01:37:42,519
Jack : I think you mean Donna Summer

1882
01:37:45,352 --> 01:37:45,910
Trevor : I don't

1883
01:37:46,786 --> 01:37:46,985
Jack : Oh

1884
01:37:48,109 --> 01:37:51,189
Jack : I mean I saw Diana in concert once She was good

1885
01:37:51,190 --> 01:37:53,147
Trevor : Good She's the best

1886
01:37:53,980 --> 01:37:55,241
Jack : Second best

1887
01:37:55,334 --> 01:37:59,273
Trevor : Okay are you sure you're not actually a patient here Like for a head injury or something

1888
01:37:59,934 --> 01:38:02,867
Jack : Are you sure you've ever heard a Donna Summer song

1889
01:38:02,928 --> 01:38:04,702
Trevor : Hot Stuff is cute

1890
01:38:05,517 --> 01:38:08,580
Trevor : But Diana's work with The Supremes alone puts Donna to shame

1891
01:38:08,581 --> 01:38:09,845
Trevor : And then there's

1892
01:38:13,534 --> 01:38:16,861
Trevor : I mean not that I like her

1893
01:38:16,862 --> 01:38:18,963
Trevor : Cause Diana's for

1894
01:38:20,214 --> 01:38:22,523
Trevor : Um And I'm not

1895
01:38:23,336 --> 01:38:27,065
Trevor : I just had this friend who's really seriously committed to her

1896
01:38:27,152 --> 01:38:28,417
Jack : Mmm

1897
01:38:28,544 --> 01:38:29,298
Trevor : But he's weird

1898
01:38:32,928 --> 01:38:36,012
Jack : Ten years ago I used to hate that word

1899
01:38:36,587 --> 01:38:42,063
Jack : Ten years ago In whispers up and down the halls

1900
01:38:42,837 --> 01:38:46,800
Jack : I knew what it meant But I couldn't let it show

1901
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:52,944
Jack : So I faded back into the walls

1902
01:38:52,945 --> 01:38:55,940
Jack : Ten years ago I used to hide myself

1903
01:38:55,941 --> 01:39:00,797
Jack : My every move was trying Just to fall in line

1904
01:39:01,310 --> 01:39:03,022
Jack : I changed how I walked

1905
01:39:03,022 --> 01:39:09,454
Jack : And when I would talk I used a voice that wasn't mine

1906
01:39:09,877 --> 01:39:13,118
Jack : And back in those days

1907
01:39:13,155 --> 01:39:18,591
Jack : I used to dream I'd wake up as somebody new

1908
01:39:19,550 --> 01:39:22,605
Jack : Back in those days

1909
01:39:22,606 --> 01:39:28,083
Jack : I'd cry and scream That every day would just be through

1910
01:39:28,084 --> 01:39:32,267
Jack : Oh back in those days

1911
01:39:32,268 --> 01:39:38,026
Jack : I'd pray and pray To be another life away

1912
01:39:38,627 --> 01:39:44,130
Jack : Where one of these days would be okay

1913
01:39:44,530 --> 01:39:50,325
Jack : Just like I heard Diana say

1914
01:39:52,203 --> 01:39:53,618
Jack : Oh never mind

1915
01:39:53,619 --> 01:39:55,071
Trevor : What Why

1916
01:39:55,072 --> 01:39:59,891
Jack : Well you wouldn't wanna hear what Diana Ross had to say at her concert

1917
01:39:59,892 --> 01:40:00,622
Trevor : It's okay

1918
01:40:01,441 --> 01:40:02,669
Trevor : You can still say it

1919
01:40:07,573 --> 01:40:11,627
Jack : Well she said

1920
01:40:12,684 --> 01:40:15,699
Jack : My darlings always remember

1921
01:40:15,939 --> 01:40:20,049
Jack : no matter how difficult it may seem at the time

1922
01:40:21,570 --> 01:40:25,345
Jack : it's always easier to live the truth than live a lie

1923
01:40:26,988 --> 01:40:30,448
Diana Ross : So be true because I'll love you no matter what

1924
01:40:30,940 --> 01:40:33,137
Diana Ross : but I love you happy most of all

1925
01:40:36,027 --> 01:40:36,942
Trevor : She didn't say that

1926
01:40:39,174 --> 01:40:42,497
Trevor : Uh it's just my friend told me everything she ever said

1927
01:40:42,498 --> 01:40:45,270
Jack : Well okay Well it wasn't anything famous

1928
01:40:45,271 --> 01:40:48,131
Jack : just something she said

1929
01:40:48,977 --> 01:40:53,432
Jack : at her concert that I saw

1930

1973
01:43:30,892 --> 01:43:33,801
Trevor : Like it sometimes always is

1974
01:43:34,921 --> 01:43:37,326
Trevor : Was I hearing my own story

1975
01:43:38,881 --> 01:43:41,184
Trevor : When I heard him telling his

1976
01:43:43,011 --> 01:43:45,576
Trevor : Like a signal out of nowhere

1977
01:43:46,797 --> 01:43:50,204
Trevor : Like a light I've never known

1978
01:43:50,205 --> 01:43:55,624
Trevor : Showing me I could be Something more than alone

1979
01:44:05,771 --> 01:44:07,989
Trevor : Is it my imagination

1980
01:44:09,240 --> 01:44:11,593
Trevor : Making daydreams out of dust

1981
01:44:12,959 --> 01:44:15,687
Trevor : Are the feelings I'm feeling

1982
01:44:16,668 --> 01:44:18,888
Trevor : Something I can really trust

1983
01:44:19,718 --> 01:44:22,850
Trevor : Like a world that finally opened

1984
01:44:23,779 --> 01:44:27,026
Trevor : From a whisper to a scream

1985
01:44:27,027 --> 01:44:31,370
Trevor : Telling me this could be Something more than a dream

1986
01:44:31,549 --> 01:44:35,547
Trevor : What if someday isn't someday

1987
01:44:35,548 --> 01:44:38,834
Trevor : What if it's right now

1988
01:44:38,829 --> 01:44:45,168
Trevor : What if who I hid is Who I get to be somehow

1989
01:44:45,257 --> 01:44:47,546
Trevor : What if weird is only different

1990
01:44:48,852 --> 01:44:50,618
Trevor : What if different isn't wrong

1991
01:44:52,604 --> 01:44:57,544
Trevor : What if normal isn't How I have to play along

1992

Trevor : Play along

1993
01:45:02,301 --> 01:45:04,345
Trevor : Is it my imagination

1994

Trevor : Like it always was before

1995
01:45:08,677 --> 01:45:11,059
Trevor : Will I hold on to this feeling

1996
01:45:12,238 --> 01:45:15,650
Trevor : When I walk out of that door

1997
01:45:15,651 --> 01:45:19,110
Trevor : Is it too much to believe now

1998
01:45:19,386 --> 01:45:20,833
Trevor : That it isn't only me

1999
