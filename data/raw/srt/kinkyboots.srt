475
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:30,221
Lauren : Oh you'll have to forgive him

476

Lola(Simon) : Ha don't kid yourself

478
00:25:34,204 --> 00:25:37,279
Lola(Simon) : You're never more than 10 steps away from some sort of crossdresser

479
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:40,305
Lola(Simon) : In any case those are not transvestites

480
00:25:40,754 --> 00:25:42,075
Lola(Simon) : They're drag queens

481
00:25:42,076 --> 00:25:42,670
Lauren : There's a difference

482
00:25:42,671 --> 00:25:43,630
Lola(Simon) : Yes

483
00:25:43,631 --> 00:25:46,501
Lola(Simon) : A drag queen puts on a frock and suddenly she's Cleopatra

484
00:25:46,502 --> 00:25:49,075
Lola(Simon) : A transvestite gets done up and often as not

485
00:25:49,076 --> 00:25:51,704
Lola(Simon) : looks like Winston Churchill in his mother's knickers

486
00:25:53,651 --> 00:25:54,616
Charlie Price : And so you are

487
00:25:54,617 --> 00:25:57,405
Lola(Simon) : Insulted that you need to ask

488
00:26:02,678 --> 00:26:05,988
Lola(Simon) : So you fired this lovely girl

489
00:26:05,989 --> 00:26:07,543
Charlie Price : Things aren't very good in men's shoes

490
00:26:07,544 --> 00:26:08,570
Lola(Simon) : Certainly I'm not

491
00:26:11,107 --> 00:26:11,988
Charlie Price : How much do you weigh

492
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:13,187
Lola(Simon) : Exactly the right amount

493
00:26:13,188 --> 00:26:15,070
Charlie Price : For a man but you're wearing women's boots

494
00:26:15,071 --> 00:26:16,560
Lola(Simon) : And I thought you weren't paying attention

495
00:26:16,548 --> 00:26:17,367
Charlie Price : Well it's all wrong

496
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,327
Lola(Simon) : Hasn't stopped me yet

497
00:26:18,351 --> 00:26:21,833
Charlie Price : A heel made for a woman cannot possibly support a man's weight

498
00:26:21,837 --> 00:26:23,017
Charlie Price : You need something special

499
00:26:23,018 --> 00:26:25,894
Lola(Simon) : And I deserve something special

500
00:26:25,926 --> 00:26:29,370
Charlie Price : Yes well if you transveterans

501
00:26:29,371 --> 00:26:31,194
Charlie Price : are everywhere like you say

502
00:26:31,203 --> 00:26:33,148
Charlie Price : then there must be a niche market

503
00:26:33,140 --> 00:26:36,975
Charlie Price : for properly builttolast women's boots for women who are men

504
00:26:37,588 --> 00:26:38,129

Charlie Price : The international shoe exhibition is in Milan next month

507
00:26:42,670 --> 00:26:47,857
Charlie Price : If we had something new to show something no one else in the world has to offer it might just save the factory

508
00:26:47,858 --> 00:26:48,772
Lauren : Oh

509
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:51,855
Charlie Price : I'd like to measure you up go back and make a sample pair

510
00:26:51,857 --> 00:26:53,062
Lola(Simon) : First riddle me this

511
00:26:53,063 --> 00:26:54,076
Lola(Simon) : Who gets to keep the boots

512
00:26:54,077 --> 00:26:55,415
Lola(Simon) : And I'll give you a hint

513
00:26:55,416 --> 00:26:57,796
Lola(Simon) : The correct answer is you do Lola

514

518
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:07,284
Lola(Simon) : You don't want me to come to Northampton do you

519
00:27:09,276 --> 00:27:09,631
Charlie Price : No

520
00:27:10,479 --> 00:27:12,816
Lola(Simon) : I'm sorry but I have a terrible habit

521
00:27:12,817 --> 00:27:15,093
Lola(Simon) : of doing exactly the opposite of what people ask

522
00:27:15,094 --> 00:27:17,837
Lola(Simon) : which might explain why I'm wearing this frock today

523
00:27:18,263 --> 00:27:20,402
Lola(Simon) : See you in Northampton

524

Charlie Price : How this Will end

533
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:53,958
Charlie Price : Maybe these pieces are fallin together

534
00:28:54,190 --> 00:28:58,018
Charlie Price : Making me feel like I'm not alone

00:53:10,140 --> 00:53:11,691
Charlie Price : I mean when you were a kid

934
00:53:13,203 --> 00:53:15,174
Lola(Simon) : Whatever it was I wanted as a kid

935
00:53:15,641 --> 00:53:17,135
Lola(Simon) : my father beat out of me

936
00:53:18,465 --> 00:53:19,458
Charlie Price : Your dad hit you

937
00:53:19,669 --> 00:53:21,249
Lola(Simon) : Not like that

938
00:53:21,495 --> 00:53:22,534
Lola(Simon) : He was a boxer

939
00:53:23,217 --> 00:53:25,262
Lola(Simon) : Yeah a proper prize fighter

940
00:53:25,290 --> 00:53:27,404
Lola(Simon) : who never got the title match he wanted

941
00:53:27,461 --> 00:53:29,568
Lola(Simon) : But presented with a baby boy

942
00:53:29,569 --> 00:53:33,024
Lola(Simon) : Well if he couldn't raise a champion's belt over his head

943
00:53:33,120 --> 00:53:33,961
Lola(Simon) : his son would

944
00:53:34,024 --> 00:53:34,830
Charlie Price : He didn't know about

945
00:53:34,831 --> 00:53:36,255
Lola(Simon) : Of course he knew

946
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:39,556
Lola(Simon) : But he figured if he pushed me trained me himself

947
00:53:39,948 --> 00:53:42,090
Lola(Simon) : ah you heard right

948
00:53:42,355 --> 00:53:44,563
Lola(Simon) : I am a professionally trained boxer

949
00:53:44,594 --> 00:53:47,949
Lola(Simon) : with a dozen amateur bouts to my name so don't try me

950
00:53:50,178 --> 00:53:55,283
Lola(Simon) : But when I appeared for a fight in a white cocktail dress

951
00:53:57,384 --> 00:53:58,643
Lola(Simon) : he disowned me

952
00:53:59,840 --> 00:54:01,159
Lola(Simon) : Refused to see me

953
00:54:03,395 --> 00:54:05,803
Lola(Simon) : even when he came down with lung cancer

954
00:54:08,106 --> 00:54:09,296
Lola(Simon) : It's ironic really

955
00:54:10,112 --> 00:54:11,701
Lola(Simon) : Fags got him in the end

956
00:54:20,213 --> 00:54:21,022
Lola(Simon) : And you

957
00:54:22,144 --> 00:54:23,644
Lola(Simon) : You like making shoes

958
00:54:26,402 --> 00:54:30,980
Charlie Price : On the day I was born my dad set me down next in line of Price Son

959
00:54:32,558 --> 00:54:34,541
Charlie Price : For him a done deal but for me

960
00:54:36,548 --> 00:54:41,937
Charlie Price : First opportunity I grabbed my childhood sweetheart and we jumped on the next train out of town

961
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:43,810
Lola(Simon) : What was it you ran off to do

962
00:54:45,179 --> 00:54:46,891
Charlie Price : Anything but what he wanted

963
00:54:48,336 --> 00:54:49,759
Lola(Simon) : And yet here you are

964
00:54:52,466 --> 00:54:53,325
Charlie Price : Here I am

965
00:54:56,045 --> 00:55:00,451
Lola(Simon) : When I was just a kid

966
00:55:03,173 --> 00:55:06,853
Lola(Simon) : Everything I did

967
00:55:07,358 --> 00:55:10,850
Lola(Simon) : Was to be like him

968
00:55:15,025 --> 00:55:20,453
Lola(Simon) : Under my skin

969
00:55:22,860 --> 00:55:27,051
Lola(Simon) : My father always thought

970
00:55:29,244 --> 00:55:33,814
Lola(Simon) : If I was strong and fought

971
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:41,446
Lola(Simon) : Not like some albatross

972
00:55:41,600 --> 00:55:43,570
Lola(Simon) : I'd begin

973
00:55:47,979 --> 00:55:53,331
Lola(Simon) : To fit in

974
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:59,531
Lola(Simon) : Look at me powerless

975
00:55:59,532 --> 00:56:02,378
Lola(Simon) : And holding my breath

976
00:56:02,865 --> 00:56:05,975
Lola(Simon) : Trying hard to repress

977
00:56:06,327 --> 00:56:09,452
Lola(Simon) : What scared him to death

978
00:56:09,598 --> 00:56:13,010
Lola(Simon) : It was never easy

979
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:16,360
Lola(Simon) : To be his type of man

980
00:56:16,361 --> 00:56:19,538
Lola(Simon) : To breathe freely

981
00:56:20,168 --> 00:56:23,418
Lola(Simon) : Was not in his plan

982
00:56:23,419 --> 00:56:29,356
Lola(Simon) : And the best part of me

983
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:36,074
Lola(Simon) : Is what he wouldn't See

984
00:56:37,020 --> 00:56:43,759
Lola(Simon) : I'm not my father's son

985
00:56:44,237 --> 00:56:47,832
Lola(Simon) : I'm not the image

986
00:56:47,899 --> 00:56:51,247
Lola(Simon) : Of what he dreamed of

987
00:56:51,248 --> 00:56:54,693
Lola(Simon) : With the strength of Sparta

988
00:56:54,982 --> 00:56:58,296
Lola(Simon) : And the patience of Job

989
00:56:58,992 --> 00:57:05,086
Lola(Simon) : Still couldn't be the one

990
00:57:06,214 --> 00:57:12,230
Lola(Simon) : To echo what he'd done

991
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:17,174
Lola(Simon) : And mirror what was not

992
00:57:17,175 --> 00:57:22,407
Lola(Simon) : In me

993
00:57:24,180 --> 00:57:27,915
Lola(Simon) : So I jumped in my dreams

994
00:57:28,020 --> 00:57:30,922
Lola(Simon) : And found an escape

995
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:34,876
Lola(Simon) : Maybe I went to extremes

996
00:57:34,877 --> 00:57:38,154
Lola(Simon) : Of leather and lace

997
00:57:38,155 --> 00:57:41,269
Lola(Simon) : But the world seemed brighter

998
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:45,047
Lola(Simon) : Six inches off the ground

999
00:57:45,048 --> 00:57:48,018
Lola(Simon) : And the air seemed lighter

1000
00:57:48,890 --> 00:57:51,503
Lola(Simon) : I was profound

1001
00:57:51,504 --> 00:57:57,890
Lola(Simon) : And I felt so Proud

1002
00:57:58,573 --> 00:58:04,655
Lola(Simon) : Just to live out Loud

1003
00:58:04,971 --> 00:58:11,749

Lola(Simon) : And mirror what was not

1011
00:58:44,150 --> 00:58:49,439
Lola(Simon) : In me

1012
00:58:52,177 --> 00:58:58,015
Lola(Simon) : The endless torrent of expectation

1013
00:58:58,349 --> 00:59:02,756
Lola(Simon) : Swirling inside my mind

1014
00:59:02,757 --> 00:59:05,766
Lola(Simon) : Wore me down

1015

Lola(Simon) : I came to a realization

1016
00:59:11,233 --> 00:59:16,465
Lola(Simon) : And I finally turned around

1017
00:59:16,466 --> 00:59:23,240
Lola(Simon) : To see

1018

Richard Bailey : Look at the detail It's not what you change about a building

1056
01:01:49,905 --> 01:01:52,768

Pat : How about we call the bank

1492

1493
01:25:29,770 --> 01:25:32,591
Charlie Price : Good day Mr Banker We've gone tits up making the best shoes in England

Trish : but some of us have a life outside this factory

1558
01:27:47,424 --> 01:27:49,507
Charlie Price : And you'll have a bloody lot more of it if I fire you

1559
01:27:53,605 --> 01:27:54,434
Charlie Price : Now do it again

Nicola : There I am havin my supper alone as usual

1570
01:28:16,668 --> 01:28:19,172
Nicola : and along comes a man to measure up the garden for the valuation

1571
01:28:19,173 --> 01:28:19,947
Charlie Price : Yeah I can explain

1573
01:28:22,238 --> 01:28:24,953
Nicola : and I'll stand by you still if you give me but one reason

1574
01:28:24,954 --> 01:28:28,591
Charlie Price : The reason is right in front of you Isn't saving Price Son worth everything

1575
01:28:28,592 --> 01:28:31,344
Nicola : Where was this passion when I was trying to make us a new life in London

1576
01:28:31,368 --> 01:28:32,349
Charlie Price : London was for you

Charlie Price : For you you wanted London and I went along

1579
01:28:36,800 --> 01:28:37,475
Nicola : Really

1580
01:28:38,861 --> 01:28:40,342
Nicola : Well you could have fooled me

1581
01:28:41,824 --> 01:28:42,992
Nicola : And what about us

1582

Nicola : Oh don't tell me it's for your father

1585
01:28:50,058 --> 01:28:53,510
Nicola : He's probably spinning in his grave over what you've turned his factory into

1586
01:28:54,897 --> 01:28:56,237
Nicola : So who's it for Charlie

1597
01:29:12,795 --> 01:29:14,905
Nicola : And this factory is riding straight off the cliff

1598
01:29:16,068 --> 01:29:18,699
Nicola : If your father was still here they'd already be out of work

Lola(Simon) : My girls don't need to be paid

1623
01:30:28,199 --> 01:30:31,638
Lola(Simon) : They'll do it for cocktails giggles and the chance to walk a professional runway

1624
01:30:31,639 --> 01:30:33,997
Lola(Simon) : and my girls do their own hair and makeup

01:30:37,040 --> 01:30:39,504
Charlie Price : We are marketing to the world's most sophisticated buyers

1628

1629
01:30:41,400 --> 01:30:42,495
Lola(Simon) : wearing their wives brassieres

1630

1631
01:30:43,841 --> 01:30:46,044
Charlie Price : There are a whole lot of us who don't watch the evening news in brassieres

1632
01:30:46,045 --> 01:30:47,649
Lola(Simon) : Well bully for you but you ain't my buyers

1633

1636
01:30:51,651 --> 01:30:53,832
Lola(Simon) : We won't be selling to anyone if we can't get to Milan

1637
01:30:53,833 --> 01:30:57,948
Charlie Price : Then there's no reason to go if all we've got to show is a bunch of Nancyboys stomping about in skirts

1638
01:30:57,949 --> 01:31:00,210
Charlie Price : We need to show these boots on women

1639

Charlie Price : Well then the deal was wrong

1643
01:31:03,627 --> 01:31:04,803
Lola(Simon) : What did that girl say to you

1644
01:31:04,804 --> 01:31:08,113
Charlie Price : I am not embarrasin the name of Price Son by parading a planeload of misfits

1645
01:31:08,114 --> 01:31:08,228
Lola(Simon) : Misfits

1649
01:31:15,249 --> 01:31:17,103

Lola(Simon) : A nursing home Charlie in Clacton

1652
01:31:19,202 --> 01:31:20,772

1653
01:31:21,164 --> 01:31:21,654
Lola(Simon) : What

1654
01:31:21,717 --> 01:31:22,301
Charlie Price : Look at you

Charlie Price : You're meant to be a business person

1656
01:31:24,560 --> 01:31:29,043
Charlie Price : How many successful designers do you think go about camped up like the entertainment at a lowrent tea dance

1657
01:31:29,044 --> 01:31:30,479
Lola(Simon) : After all I've shared with you

1658
01:31:30,480 --> 01:31:31,590
Lola(Simon) : you still think I'm wearing this

1659
01:31:31,591 --> 01:31:32,796
Lola(Simon) : for a lack of a pair of trousers

1660
01:31:32,797 --> 01:31:34,412
Charlie Price : Look I get it I understand

1661

1663
01:31:37,913 --> 01:31:39,842
Charlie Price : I'm telling you you don't have to hide

1664
01:31:39,843 --> 01:31:43,567
Charlie Price : Once the industry sees your work you'll be able to stop all of this and have a normal life

1665
01:31:43,594 --> 01:31:44,671
Lola(Simon) : You're a fool

Charlie Price : Am I

1667
01:31:45,488 --> 01:31:49,544
Charlie Price : I'd wager if we stood side by side and asked passersby which one of us is fooling himself

1668
01:31:49,539 --> 01:31:51,262
Charlie Price : most of the votes would swing your way

1669
01:31:51,311 --> 01:31:51,538
Lola(Simon) : Ha

1670

Lola(Simon) : You believe in my shoes I am not my shoes

1673
01:31:56,610 --> 01:31:57,811
Charlie Price : No you're a joke

1674
01:31:57,812 --> 01:32:00,898
Charlie Price : You think you're being all mystical and deep representing the best of both sexes
