1
00:00:15,078 --> 00:00:18,190
As around 20000 people took part in a protest against

2
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:21,920
Meanwhile hundreds of anticapitalist protestors

3
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,518
REPORTER 1 Society continues to generate waste and squander resources

4
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,319
REPORTER 2 This is a global issue

5
00:00:29,328 --> 00:00:31,711
REPORTER 3 John what's your view on the oil market's reaction

6
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:33,131
I mean earlier today we were

7
00:00:33,442 --> 00:00:35,162
Hundreds of antiwar activists

8
00:00:35,802 --> 00:00:37,549
REPORTER 4 Spain and Greece and right across Europe

9
00:00:52,170 --> 00:00:56,105
resorted to using gas stun grenades and
rubber bullets to disperse the angry crowd

10
00:00:56,425 --> 00:00:58,429
MALE PROTESTOR Hey stop filming The police can use it

11
00:01:15,237 --> 00:01:16,588
Stay back Stay back

12
00:01:17,847 --> 00:01:20,659
REPORTER 5 But the tough economy is pushing people to the brink

13
00:01:27,431 --> 00:01:30,515
The question remains are their voices being heard

14
00:05:04,454 --> 00:05:08,889
My mind is clearer now

15
00:05:09,176 --> 00:05:12,872
At last all too well

16
00:05:12,873 --> 00:05:20,466
I can see
Where we all soon will be

17
00:05:21,539 --> 00:05:25,625
If you strip away

18
00:05:25,626 --> 00:05:29,136
The myth from the man

19
00:05:29,137 --> 00:05:31,302
You will see

20
00:05:31,315 --> 00:05:37,408
Where we all soon will be

21
00:05:37,944 --> 00:05:41,938
Jesus

22
00:05:41,939 --> 00:05:45,763
You've started to believe the things they say of you

23
00:05:45,763 --> 00:05:54,119
You really do believe this talk of God is true

24
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,115
And all the good you've done will soon get swept away

25
00:05:58,255 --> 00:06:00,369
You've begun to matter more

26
00:06:00,370 --> 00:06:10,551
Than the things you say

27
00:06:10,994 --> 00:06:14,488
Listen Jesus I don't like what I see

28
00:06:14,783 --> 00:06:18,661
All I ask is that you listen to me

29
00:06:19,106 --> 00:06:20,721
And remember

30
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:25,186
I've been your righthand man all along

31
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:29,270
You have set them all on fire

32
00:06:29,511 --> 00:06:33,235
They think they've found the new messiah

33
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:39,045
And they'll hurt you when they find they're wrong

34
00:06:40,945 --> 00:06:44,351
I remember when this whole thing began

35
00:06:44,665 --> 00:06:48,459
No talk of God then We called you a man

36
00:06:48,977 --> 00:06:50,679
And believe me

37
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:54,774
My admiration for you hasn't died

38
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:59,060
But every word you say today

39
00:06:59,248 --> 00:07:03,561
Just gets twisted round some other way

40
00:07:03,977 --> 00:07:09,566
And they'll hurt you if they think you've lied

41
00:07:10,480 --> 00:07:17,302
Nazareth your famous son should have stayed a great
unknown Like his father carving wood he'd have made good

42
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:22,997
Tables chairs and oaken
chests would have suited Jesus best He'd have caused
nobody harm

43
00:07:22,998 --> 00:07:24,827
No one alarm

44
00:07:25,123 --> 00:07:28,570
Listen Jesus do you care for your race

45
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,900
Can't you see we must keep in our place

46
00:07:33,046 --> 00:07:34,685
We are occupied

47
00:07:34,935 --> 00:07:40,346
Have you forgotten how far down we are

48
00:07:40,417 --> 00:07:43,333
I am frightened by the crowd

49
00:07:43,929 --> 00:07:47,624
For we are getting much too loud

50
00:07:47,777 --> 00:07:51,769
And they will crush us if we go too far

51
00:07:51,801 --> 00:07:59,568
If we go too far

52
00:08:12,962 --> 00:08:16,238
Listen Jesus to the warning I give

53
00:08:16,799 --> 00:08:20,913
Please remember that I want us to live

54
00:08:20,914 --> 00:08:23,490
But it's sad to see our chances

55
00:08:23,487 --> 00:08:27,323
Weakening with every hour

56
00:08:27,324 --> 00:08:30,951
All of your followers are blind

57
00:08:31,755 --> 00:08:35,741
They've too much heaven on their minds

58
00:08:35,899 --> 00:08:39,700
It was beautiful but now it's sour

59
00:08:40,033 --> 00:08:46,610
Yes it's all gone sour

60
00:08:46,611 --> 00:08:50,369
Listen Jesus to the warning I give

61
00:08:50,370 --> 00:08:54,585
Please remember that I want us to live

62
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,148
Come on come on

63
00:08:56,149 --> 00:09:00,345
He won't listen to me

64
00:09:00,346 --> 00:09:10,900
So it's all

65
00:09:11,074 --> 00:09:13,675
Gone

66
00:09:14,367 --> 00:09:23,469
Sour

67
00:09:30,558 --> 00:09:35,008
What's the buzz Tell me what's ahappening

Why should you want to know

72
00:09:50,903 --> 00:09:54,239
Don't you mind about the future

73
00:09:55,478 --> 00:09:58,733
Don't you try to think ahead

74
00:09:59,719 --> 00:10:03,327
Save tomorrow for tomorrow

75
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:06,207
Think about today instead

76
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,127
What's the buzz Tell me what's ahappening

77

00:10:12,859 --> 00:10:14,738
What's the buzz Tell me what's ahappening

80
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:15,111

00:10:15,112 --> 00:10:17,322
When do we ride to Jerusalem

82
00:10:17,328 --> 00:10:19,468
When do we ride to Jerusalem

83
00:10:19,754 --> 00:10:21,750
Even tell you where I'm going

84
00:10:21,751 --> 00:10:23,927
When do we ride to Jerusalem

85
00:10:23,928 --> 00:10:26,159
When do we ride to Jerusalem

86
00:10:26,168 --> 00:10:28,368
When do we ride to Jerusalem

87
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,629
When do we ride to Jerusalem

88
00:10:30,619 --> 00:10:32,800
When do we ride to Jerusalem

89
00:10:32,801 --> 00:10:35,527
Why should you want to know

90
00:10:35,528 --> 00:10:38,439
Why are you obsessed with fighting

91
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:43,080
Times and fates you can't defy

92
00:10:44,541 --> 00:10:47,793
If you knew the path we're riding

93
00:10:48,603 --> 00:10:50,592
You'd understand it less than I

94

Mary ooh that is good

101
00:11:20,332 --> 00:11:23,487
While you prattle through your supper

102
00:11:23,734 --> 00:11:27,769
Where and when and who and how

103
00:11:28,633 --> 00:11:32,423
She alone has tried to give me

104
00:11:33,285 --> 00:11:35,090
What I need right here and now

105

What's the buzz Tell me what's ahappening

111
00:12:02,881 --> 00:12:06,157
It seems to me a strange thing

112
00:12:06,441 --> 00:12:09,022
Mystifying

113
00:12:09,023 --> 00:12:13,483
That a man like you should waste his time

114
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:17,475
On women of her kind

115
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,920
Yes I can understand that

116
00:12:21,921 --> 00:12:25,046
She amuses

117
00:12:25,046 --> 00:12:29,783
But to let her stroke you and kiss your hair

118
00:12:30,178 --> 00:12:32,536
It's hardly in your line

119
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:36,872
It's not that I object to her profession

120
00:12:37,095 --> 00:12:41,222
But she doesn't fit in well with what we teach and say

121
00:12:41,223 --> 00:12:44,586
It doesn't help us if you're inconsistent

122
00:12:44,719 --> 00:12:50,980
They only need a small excuse
To put us all away

123
00:12:51,046 --> 00:12:55,600
Who are you to criticise her
Who are you to despise her

124
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:57,866
Leave her leave her Let her be now

125
00:12:57,867 --> 00:13:00,143
Leave her leave her She's with me now

126
00:13:00,270 --> 00:13:03,506
If your slate is clean then you can throw stones

127
00:13:03,507 --> 00:13:07,061
If your slate is not then leave her alone

128
00:13:15,223 --> 00:13:17,770
I'm amazed that men like you

129
00:13:17,771 --> 00:13:20,298
Can be so shallow thick and slow

130
00:13:20,645 --> 00:13:25,229
There is not a man among you who knows or cares if I come or go

131
00:13:25,230 --> 00:13:27,729
No you're wrong You're very wrong

132
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:30,054
No you're wrong You're very wrong

133
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,359
No you're wrong You're very wrong

134
00:13:32,360 --> 00:13:34,649
No you're wrong You're very wrong

135
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,298
How can you say that

136
00:13:36,299 --> 00:13:37,949
How can you say that

137
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,565
How can you say that

138
00:13:39,566 --> 00:13:40,918
How can you say that

139
00:13:40,919 --> 00:13:42,582
Not one of you

140
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,323
Try not to get worried

141
00:13:56,324 --> 00:13:58,729
Try not to turn onto

142
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:01,190
Problems that upset you

143
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:02,314
Oh

144
00:14:02,315 --> 00:14:05,680
Don't you know everything's all right

145
00:14:05,681 --> 00:14:07,763
Yes everything's fine

146
00:14:07,929 --> 00:14:12,917
And we want you to sleep well tonight

147
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:17,897
Let the world turn without you tonight

148
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:23,160
If we try we'll get by so forget all about us tonight

149
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:25,679
Everything's all right yes

150
00:14:25,688 --> 00:14:28,044
Everything's all right yes

151
00:14:28,045 --> 00:14:30,529
Sleep and I shall soothe you

152
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:32,970
Calm you and anoint you

153
00:14:32,971 --> 00:14:35,389
Myrrh for your hot forehead

154
00:14:35,390 --> 00:14:36,590
Oh

155
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:39,815
Then you'll feel everything's all right

156
00:14:39,816 --> 00:14:41,906
Yes everything's fine

157
00:14:41,907 --> 00:14:46,957
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet

158
00:14:46,958 --> 00:14:51,839
For the fire in your head and feet

159
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:57,558
Close your eyes close your eyes
And relax think of nothing tonight

160
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:01,959
Everything's all right yes
Everything's all right yes

161
00:15:01,959 --> 00:15:06,558
Woman your fine ointment Brandnew and expensive

162
00:15:06,559 --> 00:15:10,623
Could have been saved for the poor

163
00:15:10,790 --> 00:15:13,191
Why has it been wasted

164
00:15:13,192 --> 00:15:19,632
We could have raised maybe
300 silver pieces or more

165
00:15:20,137 --> 00:15:24,878
People who are hungry
People who are starving

166
00:15:24,879 --> 00:15:28,556
Matter more than your

167
00:15:28,557 --> 00:15:35,033
Feet and hair

168
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:37,481
Try not to get worried

169
00:15:37,482 --> 00:15:42,505
Try not to turn onto
Problems that upset you

170
00:15:42,505 --> 00:15:43,424
Oh

171
00:15:43,425 --> 00:15:46,898
Don't you know everything's all right

172
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:49,204
Yes everything's fine

173
00:15:49,204 --> 00:15:53,743
And we want you to sleep well tonight

174
00:15:53,864 --> 00:15:59,133
Let the world turn without you tonight

175
00:15:59,129 --> 00:16:04,609
If we try we'll get by so forget all about us tonight

176
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:09,076
Everything's all right yes
Everything's all right yes

177
00:16:09,077 --> 00:16:13,749
Surely you're not saying
We have the resources

178
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:16,512
To save the poor from their lot

179
00:16:17,961 --> 00:16:22,544
There will be poor always pathetically struggling

180
00:16:22,545 --> 00:16:25,900
Look at the good things you've got

181
00:16:27,137 --> 00:16:29,406
Think while you still have me

182
00:16:29,408 --> 00:16:32,116
Move while you still see me

183
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:37,261
You'll be lost and you'll be so so sorry

184
00:16:37,534 --> 00:16:42,122
When I'm gone

185
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:46,962
Sleep and I shall soothe you
Calm you and anoint you

186
00:16:46,970 --> 00:16:49,396
Myrrh for your hot forehead

187
00:16:49,397 --> 00:16:50,407
Oh

188
00:16:50,408 --> 00:16:54,230
Then you'll feel everything's all right yes

189
00:16:54,231 --> 00:16:55,753
Everything's fine

190
00:16:55,917 --> 00:17:00,505
And it's cool and the ointment's sweet

191
00:17:00,762 --> 00:17:05,224
For the fire in your head and feet

192
00:17:05,384 --> 00:17:10,408
Close your eyes Close your eyes and relax
Think of nothing Tonight

193
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:15,081
Close your eyes close your eyes and relax

00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:20,161
Close your eyes close your eyes and relax Everything's all right yes

Close your eyes close your eyes and relax Everything's all right yes

203
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:07,987
Good Caiaphas

204
00:18:08,159 --> 00:18:10,937
The Council waits for you

205
00:18:11,199 --> 00:18:12,891
The Pharisees

206
00:18:13,048 --> 00:18:16,670
And priests are here for you

207
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,409
Ah gentlemen

208
00:18:20,410 --> 00:18:23,503
You know why we are here

209
00:18:23,503 --> 00:18:26,594
We've not much time

210
00:18:26,712 --> 00:18:31,621
And quite a problem here

211
00:18:31,622 --> 00:18:36,454
Hosanna Superstar
Hosanna Superstar

212
00:18:36,455 --> 00:18:41,323
Hosanna Superstar
Hosanna Superstar

213
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:46,295
Listen to that howling mob
Of blockheads in the street

214
00:18:46,663 --> 00:18:51,758
A trick or two with lepers
And the whole town's on its feet

215
00:18:51,758 --> 00:18:54,975
He is dangerous

216
00:18:55,050 --> 00:18:58,781
Jesus Christ Superstar

217
00:18:58,782 --> 00:19:02,047
He is dangerous

218
00:19:02,048 --> 00:19:03,698
Tell us that you're who they say you are

219
00:19:03,699 --> 00:19:06,329
The man is in town right now

220
00:19:06,329 --> 00:19:08,704
To whip up some support

221
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:14,283
A rabblerousing mission
That I think we must abort

222
00:19:14,283 --> 00:19:17,996
He is dangerous

223
00:19:17,997 --> 00:19:21,756
Jesus Christ
Superstar

224
00:19:21,757 --> 00:19:25,902
He is dangerous

225
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:30,487
Look Caiaphas They're right outside our yard

226
00:19:30,564 --> 00:19:34,003
Quick Caiaphas Go call the Roman guard

227
00:19:34,004 --> 00:19:35,816
No wait

228
00:19:38,375 --> 00:19:46,569
We need a more permanent solution to our problem

229
00:19:46,964 --> 00:19:50,465
What then to do about Jesus of Nazareth

230
00:19:50,739 --> 00:19:54,343
Miracle wonder man hero of fools

231
00:19:54,344 --> 00:19:58,444
No riots no army
No fighting no slogans

232
00:19:58,445 --> 00:20:02,305
Infantile sermons the multitude drools

233
00:20:02,306 --> 00:20:05,893
We dare not leave him to his own devices

234
00:20:05,894 --> 00:20:09,665
His halfwitted fans will get out of control

235
00:20:09,666 --> 00:20:13,339
But how do we stop him His glamour increases

236
00:20:13,340 --> 00:20:15,126
By leaps every minute

237
00:20:15,127 --> 00:20:17,478
He's top of the pole

238
00:20:17,479 --> 00:20:21,150
I see bad things arising

239
00:20:21,151 --> 00:20:24,906
The crowd crown him king which the Romans would ban

240
00:20:25,034 --> 00:20:28,677
I see blood and destruction

241
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:32,347
Our elimination because of one man

242
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:36,068
Blood and destruction because of one man

243
00:20:36,069 --> 00:20:39,847
Because because because of one man

244
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:43,670
Our elimination because of one man

245
00:20:43,671 --> 00:20:49,742
Because because because of one
Cause of one cause of one man

246
00:20:49,743 --> 00:20:53,696
What then to do about this Jesus mania

247
00:20:53,697 --> 00:20:57,238
How do we deal with the carpenter king

248
00:20:57,239 --> 00:21:00,762
Where do we start with a man who is bigger

249
00:21:00,865 --> 00:21:04,990
Than John was when John did his baptism thing

250
00:21:04,991 --> 00:21:08,710
Fools you have no perception

251
00:21:08,711 --> 00:21:12,318
The stakes we are gambling are frighteningly high

252
00:21:12,451 --> 00:21:16,317
We must crush him completely

253
00:21:16,318 --> 00:21:20,073
So like John before him this Jesus must die

254
00:21:20,074 --> 00:21:23,589
For the sake of the nation this Jesus must die

255
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:27,530
Must die must die this Jesus must die

256
00:21:27,531 --> 00:21:31,219
So like John before him this Jesus must die

257
00:21:31,220 --> 00:21:35,564
Must die must die This Jesus must Jesus must

258
00:21:35,565 --> 00:21:40,363
Jesus must
Die

259
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:51,015
Hosanna heysanna sanna sanna ho

Sanna hosanna hey superstar

263
00:22:07,935 --> 00:22:11,115
Tell the rabble to be quiet

264
00:22:11,115 --> 00:22:13,501
We anticipate a riot

265
00:22:13,502 --> 00:22:15,978
This common crowd

266
00:22:16,306 --> 00:22:18,723
Is much too loud

267
00:22:19,434 --> 00:22:22,089
Tell the mob who sing your song

268
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:25,041
That they are fools and they are wrong

269
00:22:25,042 --> 00:22:27,578
They are a curse

270
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,638
They should disperse

271
00:22:31,681 --> 00:22:36,690
Hosanna heysanna sanna sanna ho

272

Sanna hosanna hey superstar

276
00:22:54,195 --> 00:22:58,660
Why waste your breath moaning at the crowd

277
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:04,137
Nothing can be done to stop the shouting

278
00:23:04,634 --> 00:23:10,207
If every tongue were still
The noise would still continue

279
00:23:10,693 --> 00:23:13,500
The rocks and stones themselves

280
00:23:13,501 --> 00:23:17,520
Would start to sing

281
00:23:17,521 --> 00:23:26,877
Hosanna heysanna sanna sanna ho
Sanna heysanna hosanna

Sanna hosanna hey superstar

286
00:23:40,123 --> 00:23:43,827
Sing me a song but not for me alone

287

Yes yes

288
00:23:45,655 --> 00:23:49,841
Sing out for yourselves
For you are blessed

289
00:23:50,638 --> 00:23:52,990
There is not one of you

290
00:23:52,991 --> 00:23:55,539
Who cannot win the Kingdom

291
00:23:56,512 --> 00:23:59,100
The slow the suffering

292
00:23:59,418 --> 00:24:03,927
The quick the dead

293
00:24:03,930 --> 00:24:09,577
Hosanna heysanna sanna sanna ho

294

296
00:24:21,898 --> 00:24:29,163
Sanna hosanna hey superstar

297
00:24:29,916 --> 00:24:34,825
Superstar

298
00:25:33,841 --> 00:25:37,999
Christ you know I love you Did you see I waved

299
00:25:38,006 --> 00:25:41,845
I believe in you and God so tell me that I'm saved

300
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:45,802
Christ you know I love you Did you see I waved

00:25:46,275 --> 00:25:49,836
I believe in you and God so tell me that I'm saved

Jesus I am with you Touch me touch me Jesus

Jesus I am on your side Kiss me kiss me Jesus

304
00:25:58,198 --> 00:26:02,270
Christ what more do you need to convince you

305
00:26:02,271 --> 00:26:06,433
That you've made it and you're easily as strong

306
00:26:06,434 --> 00:26:10,112
As the filth from Rome who rape our country

307
00:26:10,551 --> 00:26:15,387
And who've terrorised our people for so long

308
00:26:15,388 --> 00:26:18,632
Christ you know I love you Did you see I waved

309
00:26:18,652 --> 00:26:19,449
They love you

310
00:26:19,450 --> 00:26:23,403
I believe in you and God so tell me that I'm saved

311
00:26:23,404 --> 00:26:27,445
Christ you know I love you Did you see I waved

312
00:26:27,671 --> 00:26:31,253

00:26:36,134 --> 00:26:39,690
Jesus I am on your side Kiss me kiss me Jesus

315
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:44,028
There must be over 50000

316
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:48,165
Screaming love and more for you

317
00:26:48,165 --> 00:26:51,608
Every one of 50000

318
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:55,615
Would do whatever you asked them to

319
00:26:55,912 --> 00:26:59,987
But keep them yelling their devotion

320
00:27:00,496 --> 00:27:03,774
Add a touch of hate at Rome

321
00:27:04,409 --> 00:27:08,981
You will rise to a greater power

322
00:27:09,101 --> 00:27:13,209
We will win ourselves a home

323
00:27:13,210 --> 00:27:15,618
You'll get the power and the glory

324
00:27:15,619 --> 00:27:16,950
You'll get the glory

325
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:19,725
Forever and ever and ever

326
00:27:19,726 --> 00:27:21,214
You'll get the power

327
00:27:21,383 --> 00:27:23,730
You'll get the power and the glory

328
00:27:23,731 --> 00:27:25,354
You'll get the glory

329
00:27:25,355 --> 00:27:28,199
Forever and ever and ever

330
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,495
 And the power

331
00:27:29,496 --> 00:27:33,643
Forever

332
00:27:33,644 --> 00:27:35,891
Forever

333
00:27:35,892 --> 00:27:37,931
You'll get the glory

334
00:27:37,932 --> 00:27:40,671
You'll get the power and the glory

335
00:27:40,672 --> 00:27:41,881
And the power

336
00:27:41,890 --> 00:27:44,537
Forever and ever and ever

337
00:27:44,538 --> 00:27:46,240
 You'll get the glory

338
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,173
You'll get the power and the glory

339
00:27:48,174 --> 00:27:50,108
 Forever amen

340
00:27:50,109 --> 00:27:52,560
Forever and ever

341
00:27:52,561 --> 00:27:58,136
Forever amen

342
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:07,535
Neither you Simon

343
00:28:07,695 --> 00:28:10,359
Nor the 50000

344
00:28:11,615 --> 00:28:16,918
Nor the Romans
Nor the Jews

345
00:28:18,103 --> 00:28:21,567
Nor Judas
Nor the 12

346
00:28:21,568 --> 00:28:25,323
Nor the priests nor the scribes

347
00:28:25,324 --> 00:28:31,537
Nor doomed Jerusalem itself

348
00:28:31,770 --> 00:28:38,338
Understand what power is

349
00:28:39,061 --> 00:28:45,735
Understand what glory is

350
00:28:45,736 --> 00:28:50,986
Understand at all

351
00:28:52,358 --> 00:28:59,572
Understand at all

352
00:29:03,632 --> 00:29:08,802
If you knew
All that I knew

353
00:29:08,808 --> 00:29:11,942
My poor Jerusalem

354
00:29:14,255 --> 00:29:19,481
You'd see the truth
But you'd close your eyes

355
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:26,756
But you'd close your eyes

356
00:29:27,713 --> 00:29:34,697
While you live
Your troubles are many

357
00:29:34,698 --> 00:29:37,327
Poor Jerusalem

358
00:29:39,355 --> 00:29:45,741
To conquer death
You only have to die

359
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:53,160
You only have to die

360
00:30:14,875 --> 00:30:19,824
I dreamed I met a Galilean

361
00:30:20,085 --> 00:30:23,140
A most amazing man

362
00:30:23,831 --> 00:30:25,717
He had that look

363
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:29,258
You very rarely find

364
00:30:30,083 --> 00:30:33,197
The haunting hunted kind

365
00:30:35,890 --> 00:30:40,877
I asked him
To say what had happened

366
00:30:42,003 --> 00:30:43,864
How it all began

367
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:47,260
I asked again

368
00:30:48,044 --> 00:30:50,227
He never said a word

369
00:30:51,506 --> 00:30:55,308
As if he hadn't heard

370
00:30:57,430 --> 00:30:59,109
And next

371
00:30:59,311 --> 00:31:05,242
The room was full
Of wild and angry men

372
00:31:06,552 --> 00:31:10,879
They seemed to hate this man

373
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:14,117
They fell on him and then

374
00:31:15,314 --> 00:31:18,122
They disappeared again

375
00:31:19,153 --> 00:31:21,753
Then I saw

376
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:28,681
Thousands of millions
Crying for this man

377
00:31:29,477 --> 00:31:34,157
And then I heard them
Mentioning my name

378
00:31:36,302 --> 00:31:42,277
And leaving me the blame

379
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:17,538
Roll on up for my price is down Come on in for the best in town

380
00:32:17,539 --> 00:32:21,805
Take your pick of the finest wine Lay your bets on this bird of mine

381
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:26,179
Roll on up for my price is down Come on in for the best in town

382
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:30,604
Take your pick of the finest wine Lay your bets on this bird of mine

383
00:32:30,605 --> 00:32:32,742
Name your price I got everything

384
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,897
Come and buy it's all going fast

385
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:37,050
Borrow cash on the finest terms

386
00:32:37,051 --> 00:32:39,201
Hurry now while stocks still last

387
00:32:39,210 --> 00:32:41,393
Roll on up Jerusalem

388
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:43,479
Here it isn't us and them

389
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:45,737
While our temples still survive

390
00:32:45,737 --> 00:32:47,880
We at least are still alive

391
00:32:47,881 --> 00:32:50,014
Come all classes come all creeds

392
00:32:50,009 --> 00:32:52,223
I can fix your wildest needs

393
00:32:52,224 --> 00:32:54,369
Name your pleasure I will sell

394
00:32:54,370 --> 00:32:56,509
I got heaven I got hell

395
00:32:56,557 --> 00:32:58,661
What you see is what you get

396
00:32:58,662 --> 00:33:00,846
No one's been disappointed yet

397
00:33:00,848 --> 00:33:03,006
Don't be scared give me a try

398
00:33:03,007 --> 00:33:05,254
There is nothing you can't buy

399
00:33:31,138 --> 00:33:35,509
Roll on up for my price is down Come on in for the best in town

400
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:39,827
Take your pick of the finest wine Lay your bets on this bird of mine

401
00:33:39,828 --> 00:33:44,157
Roll on up for my price is down Come on in for the best in town

402
00:33:45,033 --> 00:33:48,960
My temple should be

403
00:33:48,961 --> 00:33:52,298
A house of prayer

404
00:33:53,289 --> 00:33:59,597
But you have made it
A den of thieves

405
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,008
Get out

406
00:34:03,009 --> 00:34:06,842
Get out

407
00:34:16,248 --> 00:34:20,636
My time
Is almost through

408
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:27,496
Little left to do

409
00:34:30,117 --> 00:34:36,945
After all
I've tried for three years

410
00:34:37,685 --> 00:34:40,241
Seems like 30

411
00:34:41,054 --> 00:34:43,800
Seems like 30

412
00:34:51,702 --> 00:34:55,360
See my eyes I can hardly see

413
00:34:55,361 --> 00:34:58,673
See me stand I can hardly walk

414
00:34:58,687 --> 00:35:01,834
I believe you can make me whole

415
00:35:01,835 --> 00:35:05,168
See his tongue he can hardly talk

416
00:35:05,169 --> 00:35:08,468
See my skin I'm a mass of blood

417
00:35:08,513 --> 00:35:11,834
Change my life oh I know you can

418
00:35:11,835 --> 00:35:15,330
I believe you can make me well

419
00:35:15,331 --> 00:35:18,637
See my purse I'm a poor poor man

420
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:21,750
Will you touch will you mend me Christ

421
00:35:21,751 --> 00:35:24,702
Won't you touch will you heal me Christ

422
00:35:24,703 --> 00:35:27,533
Will you kiss you can cure me Christ

423
00:35:27,534 --> 00:35:30,441
Won't you kiss won't you pay me Christ

424
00:35:30,442 --> 00:35:33,132
See our eyes we can hardly see

425
00:35:33,133 --> 00:35:36,068
See us stand we can hardly walk

426
00:35:36,069 --> 00:35:38,804
We believe you can make us whole

427
00:35:38,805 --> 00:35:41,618
See the tongues that can hardly talk

428
00:35:41,609 --> 00:35:44,415
See our skin we're a mass of blood

429
00:35:44,410 --> 00:35:47,130
Change our lives oh we know you can

430
00:35:47,129 --> 00:35:49,804
We believe you can make us well

431
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:52,562
You're the hope of the poor poor man

432
00:35:52,569 --> 00:35:55,159
Will you touch will you mend me Christ

433
00:35:55,169 --> 00:35:57,693
Won't you touch will you heal me Christ

434
00:35:57,694 --> 00:36:00,341
Will you kiss you can cure me Christ

435
00:36:00,342 --> 00:36:02,802
Won't you kiss won't you pay me Christ

436
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:05,239
See our eyes we can hardly see

437
00:36:05,364 --> 00:36:07,849
See us stand we can hardly walk

438
00:36:07,850 --> 00:36:10,309
We believe you can make us whole

439
00:36:10,310 --> 00:36:12,762
See the tongues that can hardly talk

440
00:36:12,770 --> 00:36:15,160
See our skin we're a mass of blood

441
00:36:15,169 --> 00:36:17,609
Change our lives oh we know you can

442
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,070
We believe you can make us well

443
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,389
You're the hope of the poor poor man

444
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:24,847
Will you touch will you mend me Christ

445
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:27,188
Won't you touch will you heal me Christ

446
00:36:27,188 --> 00:36:29,529
Will you kiss you can cure me Christ

447
00:36:29,528 --> 00:36:31,801
Won't you kiss won't you pay me Christ

448
00:36:31,852 --> 00:36:33,801
See my eyes I can hardly see

449
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:33,929
 There's too

450
00:36:33,930 --> 00:36:35,743
See me stand I can hardly walk

451
00:36:35,744 --> 00:36:36,373
too many of you

452
00:36:36,370 --> 00:36:38,270
I believe you can make me whole

453
00:36:38,271 --> 00:36:38,730
Don't

454
00:36:38,729 --> 00:36:39,742
See my tongue I can hardly talk

455
00:36:39,743 --> 00:36:40,674
crowd me

456
00:36:40,675 --> 00:36:42,379
See my skin I'm a mass of blood

457
00:36:42,380 --> 00:36:42,874
Don't crowd me

458
00:36:42,875 --> 00:36:44,539
See my legs I can hardly stand

459
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,148
Don't crowd me

460
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:47,168
We believe you can make us well

461
00:36:47,169 --> 00:36:49,395
See my purse I'm a poor poor man

462
00:36:49,396 --> 00:36:51,432
Will you touch will you mend me Christ

463
00:36:51,433 --> 00:36:53,528
Won't you touch will you heal me Christ

464
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:55,562
Will you kiss you can cure me Christ

465
00:36:55,569 --> 00:36:56,667
Won't you kiss won't you pay me Christ

466
00:36:56,668 --> 00:36:59,533
Heal yourselves

467
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:05,020
Try not to get worried

468
00:37:05,021 --> 00:37:10,175
Try not to turn onto
Problems that upset you

469
00:37:10,175 --> 00:37:17,418
Oh don't you know everything's all right
Yes everything's fine

470
00:37:17,419 --> 00:37:21,806
And I think I shall sleep well tonight

471
00:37:22,053 --> 00:37:26,825
Let the world turn without me tonight

472
00:37:26,826 --> 00:37:36,245
If we try we'll get by so forget all about us tonight

473
00:37:40,319 --> 00:37:46,386
I don't know how to love him

474
00:37:46,817 --> 00:37:52,671
What to do
How to move him

475
00:37:52,887 --> 00:37:54,681
I've been changed

476
00:37:55,287 --> 00:37:57,958
Yes really changed

477
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:06,244
In these past few days
When I've seen myself

478
00:38:06,245 --> 00:38:12,237
I seem like someone else

479
00:38:12,238 --> 00:38:19,490
I don't know how to take this

480
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:25,661
I don't see why he moves me

481
00:38:25,662 --> 00:38:27,496
He's a man

482
00:38:28,408 --> 00:38:30,623
He's just a man

483
00:38:31,587 --> 00:38:39,078
And I've had so many men before

484
00:38:39,079 --> 00:38:44,777
In very many ways

485
00:38:44,778 --> 00:38:47,682
He's just one more

486
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:53,124
Should I bring him down

487
00:38:53,125 --> 00:38:56,032
Should I scream and shout

488
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,367
Should I speak of love

489
00:38:59,368 --> 00:39:02,248
Let my feelings out

490
00:39:02,249 --> 00:39:07,948
I never thought I'd come to this

491
00:39:08,583 --> 00:39:14,666
What's it all about

492
00:39:17,622 --> 00:39:23,895
Don't you think it's rather funny

493
00:39:24,943 --> 00:39:29,829
I should be in this position

494
00:39:29,830 --> 00:39:31,983
I'm the one

495
00:39:31,984 --> 00:39:35,489
Who's always been

496
00:39:35,828 --> 00:39:40,343
So calm so cool

497
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:43,332
No lover's fool

498
00:39:43,449 --> 00:39:48,838
Running every show

499
00:39:48,839 --> 00:39:51,707
He scares me so

500
00:40:06,188 --> 00:40:12,306
I never thought
I'd come to this

501
00:40:12,682 --> 00:40:18,549
What's it all about

502
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:27,904
Yet if he said he loved me

503
00:40:28,226 --> 00:40:30,622
I'd be lost

504
00:40:30,623 --> 00:40:33,958
I'd be frightened

505
00:40:33,970 --> 00:40:35,482
I couldn't cope

506
00:40:35,580 --> 00:40:38,887
Just couldn't cope

507
00:40:39,691 --> 00:40:44,364
I'd turn my head

508
00:40:44,365 --> 00:40:46,783
I'd back away

509
00:40:46,784 --> 00:40:52,359
I wouldn't want to know

510
00:40:52,999 --> 00:40:56,296
He scares me so

511
00:40:57,094 --> 00:41:01,487
I want him so

512
00:41:03,388 --> 00:41:13,165
I love him
So

513
00:43:10,229 --> 00:43:13,338
Now if I help you it matters that you see

514
00:43:13,339 --> 00:43:15,911
These sordid kind of things are coming hard to me

515
00:43:15,912 --> 00:43:18,483
It's taken me some time to work out what to do

516
00:43:18,483 --> 00:43:21,202
I weighed the whole thing up before I came to you

517
00:43:21,203 --> 00:43:23,694
I have no thought at all about my own reward

518
00:43:23,695 --> 00:43:26,366
I really didn't come here of my own accord

519
00:43:26,367 --> 00:43:29,848
Just don't say I'm

520
00:43:31,771 --> 00:43:35,262
Damned for all time

521
00:43:36,862 --> 00:43:39,226
I came because I had to I'm the one who saw

522
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:42,049
Jesus can't control it like he did before

523
00:43:42,091 --> 00:43:44,699
And furthermore I know that Jesus thinks so too

524
00:43:44,700 --> 00:43:46,999
Jesus wouldn't mind that I'm here with you

525
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:49,769
I have no thought at all about my own reward

526
00:43:49,953 --> 00:43:52,566
I really didn't come here of my own accord

527
00:43:52,567 --> 00:43:55,816
Just don't say I'm

528
00:43:57,916 --> 00:44:01,363
Damned for all time

529
00:44:13,552 --> 00:44:16,004
Annas you're a friend a worldly man and wise

530
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,707
Caiaphas my friend I know you sympathise

531
00:44:18,707 --> 00:44:21,134
Why are we the prophets Why are we the ones

532
00:44:21,134 --> 00:44:23,682
We see the sad solution Know what must be done

533
00:44:23,683 --> 00:44:26,375
I have no thought at all about my own reward

534
00:44:26,376 --> 00:44:29,118
I really didn't come here of my own accord

535
00:44:29,118 --> 00:44:31,605
Just don't say I'm

536
00:44:31,827 --> 00:44:38,927
Damned
For all time

537
00:44:39,733 --> 00:44:41,525
Cut the protesting

538
00:44:41,528 --> 00:44:43,274
Forget the excuses

539
00:44:43,275 --> 00:44:44,832
We want information

540
00:44:45,285 --> 00:44:46,872
Get up off the floor

541
00:44:46,873 --> 00:44:50,464
We have the papers
We need to arrest him

542
00:44:50,465 --> 00:44:53,920
You know his movements
We know the law

543
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,400
Your help in this matter won't go unrewarded

544
00:44:57,401 --> 00:45:01,108
We'll pay you in silver Cash on the nail

545
00:45:01,109 --> 00:45:04,743
We just need to know where our soldiers can find him

546
00:45:04,744 --> 00:45:06,810
With no crowd round him

547
00:45:06,811 --> 00:45:08,544
Then we can't fail

548
00:45:08,545 --> 00:45:11,969
I don't need your blood money

549
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:15,144
That doesn't matter our expenses are good

550
00:45:15,597 --> 00:45:18,814
I don't want your blood money

551
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,335
But you might as well take it We think that you should

552
00:45:22,683 --> 00:45:26,247
Think of the things you could do with that money

553
00:45:26,247 --> 00:45:29,759
Choose any charity give to the poor

554
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:33,223
We've noted your motives We've noted your feelings

555
00:45:33,229 --> 00:45:35,475
This isn't blood money it's a fee

556
00:45:35,535 --> 00:45:36,609
Just a fee

557
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:41,741
It's a fee nothing more

558
00:45:59,598 --> 00:46:02,996
On Thursday night

559
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:07,794
You'll find him where you want him

560
00:46:10,798 --> 00:46:15,068
Far from the crowds

561
00:46:15,804 --> 00:46:21,298
In the Garden Of

562
00:46:21,404 --> 00:46:27,541
Gethsemane

563
00:46:27,862 --> 00:46:33,557
Well done Judas

564
00:46:34,004 --> 00:46:39,673
Good old Judas

565
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:45,782
Well done Judas

566
00:46:45,925 --> 00:46:51,351
Good old Judas

567
00:46:51,663 --> 00:46:57,159
Well done Judas

568
00:46:57,613 --> 00:47:03,115
Good old Judas

569
00:47:03,549 --> 00:47:09,002
Well done Judas

570
00:47:09,482 --> 00:47:14,901
Good old Judas

571
00:47:31,565 --> 00:47:38,362
Look at all my trials and tribulations

572
00:47:38,500 --> 00:47:43,304
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

573
00:47:43,305 --> 00:47:45,725
Pool of wine

574
00:47:45,726 --> 00:47:52,076
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers

575
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:58,811
Till this evening is this morning
Life is fine

576
00:47:59,919 --> 00:48:06,667
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle

577
00:48:07,204 --> 00:48:13,657
Knew that I would make it if I tried

578
00:48:14,213 --> 00:48:20,520
Then when we retire
We can write the gospels

579
00:48:20,528 --> 00:48:27,832
So they'll still talk about us when we've died

580
00:48:36,638 --> 00:48:39,035
The end

581
00:48:40,257 --> 00:48:46,282
Is just a little harder When

582
00:48:46,290 --> 00:48:51,348
brought about
By friends

583
00:48:54,049 --> 00:48:58,859
For all you care

584
00:48:59,639 --> 00:49:05,085
This wine could be my blood

585
00:49:07,121 --> 00:49:12,003
For all you care

586
00:49:12,874 --> 00:49:18,224
This bread
Could be my body

587
00:49:19,891 --> 00:49:21,111
The end

588
00:49:22,814 --> 00:49:26,213
This is my blood you drink

589
00:49:26,313 --> 00:49:30,860
This is my body you eat

590
00:49:31,824 --> 00:49:35,710
If you would remember me

591
00:49:35,746 --> 00:49:41,283
When you eat and drink

592
00:49:41,332 --> 00:49:44,930
I must be mad thinking I'll be remembered

593
00:49:44,931 --> 00:49:47,994
Yes I must be out of my head

594
00:49:49,062 --> 00:49:52,768
Look at your blank faces
My name will mean nothing

595
00:49:52,832 --> 00:49:55,362
Ten minutes after I'm dead

596
00:49:56,513 --> 00:49:58,510
One of you denies me

597
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:00,722
One of you betrays me

598
00:50:19,893 --> 00:50:23,513
Peter will deny me in just a few hours

599
00:50:23,514 --> 00:50:25,447
Three times will deny me

600
00:50:25,448 --> 00:50:27,329
And that's not all I see

601
00:50:27,330 --> 00:50:30,914
One of you here dining One of my 12 chosen

602
00:50:30,914 --> 00:50:32,881
Will leave to betray me

603
00:50:32,898 --> 00:50:36,532
Cut out the dramatics You know very well who

604
00:50:36,532 --> 00:50:38,444
Why don't you go do it

605
00:50:38,445 --> 00:50:40,259
You want me to do it

606
00:50:40,260 --> 00:50:41,979
Hurry they are waiting

607
00:50:42,015 --> 00:50:43,839
If you knew why I do it

608
00:50:43,840 --> 00:50:45,632
I don't care why you do it

609
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:49,241
To think I admired you Well now I despise you

610
00:50:49,242 --> 00:50:50,996
You liar you Judas

611
00:50:50,997 --> 00:50:53,076
You wanted me to do it

612
00:50:53,077 --> 00:50:56,999
What if I just stayed here and ruined your ambition

613
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,021
Christ you deserve it

614
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:01,330
Hurry you fool Hurry and go

615
00:51:01,339 --> 00:51:05,011
Save me your speeches I don't want to know

616
00:51:05,205 --> 00:51:07,599
Go

617
00:51:07,609 --> 00:51:13,522
Look at all my trials and tribulations

618
00:51:13,548 --> 00:51:19,537
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

619
00:51:19,705 --> 00:51:25,121
What's that in the bread
It's gone to my head

620
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:28,159
Till this morning is this evening

621
00:51:28,169 --> 00:51:30,944
Life is fine

622
00:51:31,923 --> 00:51:37,647
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle

623
00:51:37,798 --> 00:51:43,837
Knew that I would make it if I tried

624
00:51:43,984 --> 00:51:46,495
Then when we retire

625
00:51:46,496 --> 00:51:49,508
We can write the gospels

626
00:51:49,509 --> 00:51:53,723
So they'll all talk about us when we've died

627
00:51:53,930 --> 00:51:56,018
You sad pathetic man

628
00:51:56,019 --> 00:52:00,383
Look what you've brought us to
Our ideals die around us

629
00:52:00,384 --> 00:52:02,265
And all because of you

630
00:52:02,266 --> 00:52:04,527
And now the saddest cut of all

631
00:52:04,528 --> 00:52:07,079
Is someone had to turn you in

632
00:52:07,080 --> 00:52:09,209
Like a common criminal

633
00:52:09,210 --> 00:52:11,784
Like a wounded animal

634
00:52:11,785 --> 00:52:16,058
A jaded mandarin
Like a jaded mandarin

635
00:52:16,059 --> 00:52:19,997
Like a faded jaded jaded faded faded mandarin

636
00:52:20,017 --> 00:52:22,386
Get out They're waiting

637
00:52:22,387 --> 00:52:24,929
Get out

638
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:26,536
They're waiting

639
00:52:26,537 --> 00:52:30,730
Oh they're waiting for you

640
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:33,394
Every time I look at you

641
00:52:33,395 --> 00:52:36,611
I don't understand

642
00:52:36,612 --> 00:52:42,865
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand

643
00:52:42,866 --> 00:52:45,628
You'd have managed better

644
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:49,692
If you'd had it planned

645
00:52:49,693 --> 00:52:56,220
Why

646
00:53:11,611 --> 00:53:17,779
Look at all my trials and tribulations

647
00:53:18,211 --> 00:53:24,159
Sinking in a gentle pool of wine

648
00:53:24,917 --> 00:53:30,890
Don't disturb me now
I can see the answers

649
00:53:30,910 --> 00:53:36,650
Till this evening is this morning
Life is fine

650
00:53:38,306 --> 00:53:44,371
Always hoped that I'd be an apostle

651
00:53:44,897 --> 00:53:50,816
Knew that I would make it if I tried

652
00:53:51,586 --> 00:53:54,221
Then when we retire

653
00:53:54,241 --> 00:53:57,647
We can write the gospels

654
00:53:57,648 --> 00:54:06,984
So they'll still talk about us when we've died

655
00:54:09,788 --> 00:54:14,305
Will no one stay awake with me

656
00:54:17,536 --> 00:54:18,774
Peter

657
00:54:20,401 --> 00:54:21,049
John

658
00:54:22,683 --> 00:54:24,050
James

659
00:54:26,936 --> 00:54:32,964
Will none of you wait with me

660
00:54:35,852 --> 00:54:37,008
Peter

661
00:54:38,216 --> 00:54:39,174
John

662
00:54:40,683 --> 00:54:42,885
James

663
00:54:50,899 --> 00:54:55,979
I only want to say

664
00:54:57,245 --> 00:55:01,557
If there is a way

665
00:55:03,393 --> 00:55:09,006
Take this cup away from me

666
00:55:09,814 --> 00:55:15,032
For I don't want to taste its poison

667
00:55:15,584 --> 00:55:18,842
Feel it burn me

668
00:55:18,843 --> 00:55:21,148
I have changed

669
00:55:21,149 --> 00:55:22,855
I'm not as sure

670
00:55:24,109 --> 00:55:27,258
As when we started

671
00:55:27,864 --> 00:55:32,577
Then I was inspired

672
00:55:33,729 --> 00:55:38,813
Now
I'm sad and tired

673
00:55:39,056 --> 00:55:41,215
Listen

674
00:55:41,622 --> 00:55:47,939
Surely I've exceeded expectations

675
00:55:48,067 --> 00:55:51,357
I tried for three years

676
00:55:51,833 --> 00:55:54,604
Seems like 30

677
00:55:55,284 --> 00:55:58,033
Could you ask as much

678
00:55:58,133 --> 00:56:03,575
From any other man

679
00:56:03,576 --> 00:56:08,828
But if I die

680
00:56:08,975 --> 00:56:14,511
See the saga through
And do the things you ask of me

681
00:56:15,124 --> 00:56:20,698
Let them hate me hit me hurt me
Nail me to their tree

682
00:56:20,699 --> 00:56:24,077
I'd want to know I'd want to know my God

683
00:56:24,078 --> 00:56:26,802
I'd want to know I'd want to know my God

684
00:56:26,802 --> 00:56:29,524
I'd want to see I'd want to see my God

685
00:56:29,528 --> 00:56:32,561
I'd want to see I'd want to see my God

686
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:37,504
Why I should die

687
00:56:37,835 --> 00:56:43,280
Would I be more noticed
Than I ever was before

688
00:56:43,951 --> 00:56:48,952
Would the things I've said and done
Matter any more

689
00:56:49,644 --> 00:56:52,484
I'd have to know I'd have to know my Lord

690
00:56:52,485 --> 00:56:55,286
I'd have to know I'd have to know my Lord

691
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:58,048
I'd have to see I'd have to see my Lord

692
00:56:58,049 --> 00:57:00,929
I'd have to see I'd have to see my Lord

693
00:57:00,930 --> 00:57:03,639
If I die what would be my reward

694
00:57:03,640 --> 00:57:06,454
If I die what would be my reward

695
00:57:06,455 --> 00:57:09,372
Have to know Have to know my Lord

696
00:57:09,370 --> 00:57:12,737
Have to know Have to know my Lord

697
00:57:12,738 --> 00:57:16,855
Why

698
00:57:16,856 --> 00:57:23,117
Should I die

699
00:57:23,118 --> 00:57:25,625
Can you show me now

700
00:57:25,626 --> 00:57:28,618
That I would not be killed in vain

701
00:57:28,619 --> 00:57:34,463
Show me just a little
Of your omnipresent brain

702
00:57:34,623 --> 00:57:37,445
Show me there's a reason

703
00:57:37,446 --> 00:57:43,219
For your wanting me to die
You're far too keen on where and how

704
00:57:43,220 --> 00:57:46,344
And not so hot on why

705
00:57:47,285 --> 00:57:49,301
All right

706
00:57:49,885 --> 00:57:51,622
I'll die

707
00:57:52,757 --> 00:57:57,798
Just watch me die

708
00:57:58,528 --> 00:58:04,484
See how I die

709
00:58:04,791 --> 00:58:11,801
See how I die

710
00:58:40,427 --> 00:58:45,982
Then
I was inspired

711
00:58:47,413 --> 00:58:53,199
Now
I'm sad and tired

712
00:58:54,779 --> 00:59:00,895
After all
I've tried for three years

713
00:59:01,227 --> 00:59:04,145
Seems like 90

714
00:59:04,625 --> 00:59:10,625
Why then am I scared to finish

715
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:15,028
What I started

716
00:59:16,430 --> 00:59:18,127
What you started

717
00:59:19,203 --> 00:59:21,507
I didn't start it

718
00:59:21,508 --> 00:59:27,504
God thy will be done

719
00:59:29,076 --> 00:59:34,158
Take your only son

720
00:59:35,351 --> 00:59:42,160
I will drink your cup of poison

721
00:59:42,161 --> 00:59:46,283
Nail me to your cross

722
00:59:46,284 --> 00:59:48,552
And break me

723
00:59:49,151 --> 00:59:50,608
Bleed me

724
00:59:50,609 --> 00:59:53,415
Beat me kill me

725
00:59:53,865 --> 00:59:56,243
Take me now

726
00:59:56,249 --> 01:00:02,520
Before I change my mind

727
01:00:02,520 --> 01:00:05,097
Now

728
01:00:05,089 --> 01:00:14,463
Before I change my mind

729
01:00:57,692 --> 01:01:00,000
There he is

730
01:01:01,730 --> 01:01:06,504
They're all asleep the fools

731
01:01:14,652 --> 01:01:19,339
Judas must you betray me

732
01:01:19,547 --> 01:01:23,093
With a kiss

733
01:01:25,340 --> 01:01:28,424
What's the buzz Tell me what's happening

734
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:33,416
What's the buzz Tell me what's happening

735
01:01:33,417 --> 01:01:36,909
Tell me what's happening

736
01:01:37,533 --> 01:01:43,642
What's the buzz Tell me what's happening
What's the buzz Tell me what's happening

737
01:01:43,643 --> 01:01:46,489
What's the buzz Tell me what's happening

738
01:01:46,490 --> 01:01:49,045
What's the buzz Tell me what's happening

739
01:01:49,049 --> 01:01:54,309
Hang on Lord We're gonna fight for you
Hang on Lord We're gonna fight for you

740
01:01:54,319 --> 01:01:59,568
You hang on Lord We're gonna fight for you

741
01:01:59,569 --> 01:02:02,632
Put away your sword

742
01:02:02,633 --> 01:02:06,276
Don't you know that it's all over

743
01:02:07,731 --> 01:02:11,203
It was nice but now it's gone

744
01:02:12,407 --> 01:02:16,161
Why are you obsessed with fighting

745
01:02:17,596 --> 01:02:20,804
Stick to fishing from now on

746
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:24,204
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight

747
01:02:24,205 --> 01:02:27,650
Do you plan to put up a fight

748
01:02:27,651 --> 01:02:31,153
Do you feel that you've had the breaks

749
01:02:31,154 --> 01:02:34,615
What would you say were your big mistakes

750
01:02:34,616 --> 01:02:38,068
How do you view your coming trial

751
01:02:38,078 --> 01:02:41,525
Have your men proved at all worthwhile

752
01:02:41,526 --> 01:02:44,786
Did you pick an efficient team

753
01:02:44,787 --> 01:02:47,904
Is that it for the Jewish dream

754
01:02:47,905 --> 01:02:50,804
Come with us to see Caiaphas

755
01:02:50,810 --> 01:02:53,605
You'll just love the high priest's house

756
01:02:53,606 --> 01:02:56,134
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas

757
01:02:56,140 --> 01:02:58,480
You'll just die in the high priest's house

758
01:02:58,490 --> 01:03:00,809
Come on God this is not like you

759
01:03:00,887 --> 01:03:03,201
Let us know what you're gonna do

760
01:03:03,202 --> 01:03:05,667
You know what your supporters feel

761
01:03:05,668 --> 01:03:07,978
You'll escape in the final reel

762
01:03:07,979 --> 01:03:10,280
Tell me Christ how you feel tonight

763
01:03:10,290 --> 01:03:12,508
Do you plan to put up a fight

764
01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:14,684
Do you feel that you had the breaks

765
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:17,022
What would you say were your big mistakes

766
01:03:17,028 --> 01:03:19,189
Come with us to see Caiaphas

767
01:03:19,189 --> 01:03:21,416
You'll just love the high priest's house

768
01:03:21,410 --> 01:03:23,672
You'll just love seeing Caiaphas

769
01:03:23,679 --> 01:03:25,679
You'll just die in the high priest's house

770
01:03:25,689 --> 01:03:28,119
Now we have him now we've got him

771
01:03:28,129 --> 01:03:30,599
Now we have him now we've got him

772
01:03:30,609 --> 01:03:33,037
Now we have him now we've got him

773
01:03:33,038 --> 01:03:35,480
Now we have him now we've got him

774
01:03:35,531 --> 01:03:39,118
Now we have him now We have got him now

775
01:03:39,119 --> 01:03:41,331
Jesus you must realise

776
01:03:41,330 --> 01:03:43,827
The serious charges facing you

777
01:03:43,827 --> 01:03:47,546
You say you're the son of God in all your handouts

778
01:03:47,549 --> 01:03:48,855
Well is it true

779
01:03:48,856 --> 01:03:51,709
That's what you say You say that I am

780
01:03:53,708 --> 01:03:55,863
There you have it gentlemen

781
01:03:56,226 --> 01:03:58,576
What more evidence do you need

782
01:03:58,643 --> 01:04:01,077
Judas thank you for the victim

783
01:04:01,078 --> 01:04:02,163
Stay a while

784
01:04:02,164 --> 01:04:03,706
 and you'll see him bleed

785
01:04:03,707 --> 01:04:06,045
Now we have him now we've got him

786
01:04:06,046 --> 01:04:08,489
Now we have him now we've got him

787
01:04:08,490 --> 01:04:10,849
Now we have him now we've got him

788
01:04:10,850 --> 01:04:13,243
Now we have him now we've got him

789
01:04:13,244 --> 01:04:16,731
Take him to Pilate take him to Pilate

790
01:04:16,732 --> 01:04:20,684
Take him to Pilate take him to Pilate

791
01:04:21,402 --> 01:04:24,627
I think I've seen you somewhere

792
01:04:24,628 --> 01:04:27,525
I remember

793
01:04:27,526 --> 01:04:32,094
You were with that man they took away

794
01:04:32,095 --> 01:04:35,285
I recognise your face

795
01:04:37,135 --> 01:04:40,384
You've got the wrong man lady

796
01:04:40,385 --> 01:04:43,379
I don't know him

797
01:04:43,380 --> 01:04:47,512
And I wasn't where he was tonight

798
01:04:48,404 --> 01:04:50,781
Never near the place

799
01:04:51,093 --> 01:04:55,515
That's strange for I am sure I saw you with him

800
01:04:55,516 --> 01:04:59,295
You were right by his side and yet you denied

801
01:04:59,308 --> 01:05:02,734
I tell you I was never ever with him

802
01:05:03,587 --> 01:05:07,708
But I saw you too He looked just like you

803
01:05:07,709 --> 01:05:09,583
I don't know him

804
01:05:10,658 --> 01:05:12,153
Peter

805
01:05:12,154 --> 01:05:16,642
Don't you know what you have said

806
01:05:16,845 --> 01:05:20,316
You've gone and cut him dead

807
01:05:23,046 --> 01:05:27,252
I had to do it
Don't you see

808
01:05:28,561 --> 01:05:31,505
Or else they'd go for me

809
01:05:34,143 --> 01:05:39,517
It's what he told us you would do

810
01:05:40,043 --> 01:05:43,894
I wonder how he knew

811
01:06:29,014 --> 01:06:34,244
Who is
This broken man

812
01:06:34,884 --> 01:06:36,862
Cluttering up

813
01:06:37,472 --> 01:06:40,325
My hallway

814
01:06:40,789 --> 01:06:46,062
Who is this unfortunate

815
01:06:46,576 --> 01:06:51,100
Someone Christ King of the Jews

816
01:06:51,844 --> 01:06:54,897
Oh so this is Jesus Christ

817
01:06:55,371 --> 01:06:58,007
I am really quite surprised

818
01:06:58,008 --> 01:06:59,523
You look so small

819
01:07:00,472 --> 01:07:02,588
Not a king at all

820
01:07:03,756 --> 01:07:06,725
We all know that you are news

821
01:07:06,824 --> 01:07:08,296
But are you King

822
01:07:08,743 --> 01:07:10,887
King of the Jews

823
01:07:12,384 --> 01:07:14,151
That's what you say

824
01:07:16,424 --> 01:07:18,609
What do

825
01:07:18,847 --> 01:07:21,811
You mean by that

826
01:07:22,247 --> 01:07:27,615
That is not an answer

827
01:07:28,105 --> 01:07:33,319
You're deep
In trouble friend

828
01:07:34,158 --> 01:07:37,792
Someone Christ King of the Jews

829
01:07:39,416 --> 01:07:41,842
How can someone in your state

830
01:07:42,656 --> 01:07:44,901
Be so cool about his fate

831
01:07:46,810 --> 01:07:48,327
An amazing thing

832
01:07:49,782 --> 01:07:51,269
This silent king

833
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:54,115
Since you come from Galilee

834
01:07:55,131 --> 01:07:57,464
Then you need not come to me

835
01:07:57,569 --> 01:07:59,184
You're Herod's race

836
01:08:00,576 --> 01:08:02,545
He's Herod's case

837
01:08:03,655 --> 01:08:08,945
Hosanna heysanna
Sanna sanna ho

838
01:08:08,948 --> 01:08:14,377
Sanna heysanna hosanna

839
01:08:14,469 --> 01:08:17,572
Hey J. C J. C

840
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:20,398
Please explain to me

841
01:08:20,399 --> 01:08:24,800
You had everything
Where is it now

842
01:08:38,806 --> 01:08:40,202
Jesus

843
01:08:40,203 --> 01:08:42,613
I am overjoyed

844
01:08:42,941 --> 01:08:46,598
To meet you facetoface

845
01:08:48,241 --> 01:08:51,444
You've been getting quite a name

846
01:08:51,677 --> 01:08:55,103
All around the place

847
01:08:56,941 --> 01:08:58,677
Healing cripples

848
01:08:58,678 --> 01:09:00,269
Ooh

849
01:09:00,279 --> 01:09:03,108
Raising from the dead

850
01:09:03,109 --> 01:09:04,909
Ah

851
01:09:04,910 --> 01:09:05,967
That's pretty good

852
01:09:08,143 --> 01:09:11,978
And now I understand you're God

853
01:09:13,312 --> 01:09:17,929
At least that's what he said

854
01:09:18,094 --> 01:09:20,105
So

855
01:09:20,800 --> 01:09:24,936
You are the Christ
You're the great Jesus Christ

856
01:09:25,314 --> 01:09:27,778
Prove to me that you're divine

857
01:09:27,779 --> 01:09:29,881
Change my water into wine

858
01:09:29,882 --> 01:09:31,600
That's all you need do

859
01:09:31,601 --> 01:09:34,071
And I'll know it's all true

860
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:38,252
Come on King of the Jews

861
01:09:39,026 --> 01:09:43,982
Jesus you just won't believe the hit you've made around here

862
01:09:43,983 --> 01:09:48,167
You're all we talk about The wonder of the year

863
01:09:48,168 --> 01:09:52,749
But oh what a pity if it's all a lie

864
01:09:52,749 --> 01:09:58,091
Still I'm sure that you can rock the cynics if you try

865
01:09:58,092 --> 01:10:03,369
So if you are the Christ
Yes the great Jesus Christ

866
01:10:03,370 --> 01:10:06,021
Prove to me that you're no fool

867
01:10:06,022 --> 01:10:07,898
Walk across my swimming pool

868
01:10:07,899 --> 01:10:09,675
If you do that for me

869
01:10:09,676 --> 01:10:12,606
Then I'll let you go free

870
01:10:12,607 --> 01:10:16,014
Come on King of the Jews

871
01:10:16,207 --> 01:10:17,468
So you decide

872
01:10:17,469 --> 01:10:19,053
Is he the Lord or is he a fraud

873
01:10:19,048 --> 01:10:21,437
Text our number now We'll see you after the break

874
01:10:36,022 --> 01:10:39,978
I only ask things I'd ask any superstar

875
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:44,548
What is it that you've got that puts you where you are

876
01:10:44,982 --> 01:10:47,127
Oh I am waiting

877
01:10:47,128 --> 01:10:49,159
Yes I'm a captive fan

878
01:10:49,226 --> 01:10:54,669
I'm dying to be shown that you are not just any man

879
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:59,848
So if you are the Christ
Yes the great Jesus Christ

880
01:10:59,961 --> 01:11:02,496
Feed my household with this bread

881
01:11:02,496 --> 01:11:08,890
You can do it on your head Or has something
gone wrong Why do you take so long

882
01:11:09,349 --> 01:11:12,989
Come on King of the Jews

883
01:11:14,446 --> 01:11:18,668
Hey aren't you

884
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:21,464
Scared of me Christ

885
01:11:21,465 --> 01:11:25,181
Mr Wonderful Christ

886
01:11:25,609 --> 01:11:30,418
You're a joke You're not the Lord You are nothing but a fraud

887
01:11:30,419 --> 01:11:34,954
Take him away
He's got nothing to say

888
01:11:35,380 --> 01:11:37,593
Get out you King of the

Thank you Birmingham and good night

894
01:12:47,789 --> 01:12:52,889
I've been living to see you

895
01:12:54,204 --> 01:12:59,897
Dying to see you but it shouldn't be like this

896
01:13:00,835 --> 01:13:03,664
This was unexpected

897
01:13:04,035 --> 01:13:07,347
What do I do now

898
01:13:07,487 --> 01:13:10,867
Could we start again please

899
01:13:10,868 --> 01:13:14,057
Could we start again please

900
01:13:14,058 --> 01:13:19,752
I've been very hopeful so far

901
01:13:20,574 --> 01:13:23,692
Now for the first time

902
01:13:23,693 --> 01:13:26,709
I think we're going wrong

903
01:13:27,278 --> 01:13:29,781
Hurry up and tell me

904
01:13:30,581 --> 01:13:33,434
This is all a dream

905
01:13:33,435 --> 01:13:37,171
Or could we start again please

906
01:13:37,172 --> 01:13:40,307
Could we start again please

907
01:13:40,850 --> 01:13:46,255
I think you've made your point now

908
01:13:46,486 --> 01:13:52,893
You've even gone a bit too far
To get your message home

909
01:13:53,315 --> 01:13:56,137
Before it gets too frightening

910
01:13:56,415 --> 01:13:59,623
We ought to call a halt

911
01:14:00,078 --> 01:14:03,238
could we start again please

912
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:06,771

Dying to see you but it shouldn't be like this

915
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:22,630
This was unexpected

916
01:14:22,631 --> 01:14:26,273
What do I do now

917
01:14:26,274 --> 01:14:29,737
Could we start again please

918
01:14:29,730 --> 01:14:33,134
Could we start again please

919
01:14:33,419 --> 01:14:38,959
I think you've made your point now

920
01:14:39,016 --> 01:14:45,603
You've even gone a bit too far to get your message home

921
01:14:46,065 --> 01:14:49,207
Before it gets too frightening

922
01:14:49,208 --> 01:14:52,429
We ought to call a halt

923
01:14:52,430 --> 01:14:55,920
So could we start again please

924
01:14:56,088 --> 01:14:59,768

925
01:14:59,768 --> 01:15:03,456

927
01:15:26,919 --> 01:15:27,657
Guards

928
01:15:27,658 --> 01:15:29,526
My God I saw him

929
01:15:29,527 --> 01:15:33,967
He looked threequarters dead and he was so bad I had to turn my head

930
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:36,711
They beat him so hard that he was bent and lame

931
01:15:36,712 --> 01:15:39,401
And I know who everybody's gonna blame

932
01:15:39,402 --> 01:15:42,020
I don't believe he knows I acted for our good

933
01:15:42,021 --> 01:15:45,009
I'd save him all this suffering if I could

934
01:15:45,010 --> 01:15:48,172
Don't believe Our good

935
01:15:50,165 --> 01:15:53,125
I'd save him if I could

936
01:15:55,846 --> 01:15:59,097
Cut the confession forget the excuses

937
01:15:59,098 --> 01:16:02,916
I don't understand why you're filled with remorse

938
01:16:02,917 --> 01:16:06,289
All that you've said has come true with a vengeance

939
01:16:06,289 --> 01:16:09,875
The mob turned against him You backed the right horse

940
01:16:09,876 --> 01:16:13,442
What you have done will be the saving of Israel

941
01:16:13,443 --> 01:16:16,710
You'll be remembered forever for this

942
01:16:16,840 --> 01:16:20,562
And not only that You've been paid for your efforts

943
01:16:20,667 --> 01:16:24,219
Pretty good wages for one little kiss

944
01:16:24,220 --> 01:16:27,485
Christ I know you can't hear me

945
01:16:27,485 --> 01:16:31,130
But I only did what you wanted me to

946
01:16:31,131 --> 01:16:34,557
Christ I'd sell out the nation

947
01:16:34,558 --> 01:16:37,917
For I have been saddled with the murder of you

948
01:16:38,079 --> 01:16:41,482
I have been spattered with innocent blood

949
01:16:41,483 --> 01:16:45,337
I shall be dragged through the slime and the mud

950
01:16:45,338 --> 01:16:48,535
I have been spattered with innocent blood

951
01:16:48,536 --> 01:16:58,019
I shall be dragged through the slime
and the slime and the Slime and the mud

952
01:16:59,444 --> 01:17:08,670
I
Don't know how to love him

953
01:17:10,974 --> 01:17:15,793
I don't know why he moves me

954
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:17,481
He's a man

955
01:17:17,554 --> 01:17:19,805
He's just a man

956
01:17:22,360 --> 01:17:25,488
He is not a king

957
01:17:25,489 --> 01:17:28,663
He's just the same

958
01:17:29,522 --> 01:17:34,524
As anyone I know

959
01:17:34,811 --> 01:17:39,453
He scares me so

960
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,955
When he's cold and dead

961
01:17:45,306 --> 01:17:48,870
Will he let me be Does he love

962
01:17:48,969 --> 01:17:52,091
Does he love me too

963
01:17:52,092 --> 01:18:01,630
Does he care for me

964
01:18:23,669 --> 01:18:27,066
My mind is in darkness now

965
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:33,635
Oh God I am sick

966
01:18:33,636 --> 01:18:36,636
I've been used

967
01:18:36,637 --> 01:18:40,738
And you knew all the time

968
01:18:43,388 --> 01:18:47,846
God I will never ever know

969
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:53,927
Why you chose me

970
01:18:53,928 --> 01:18:56,630
For your crime

971
01:18:57,130 --> 01:19:03,714
For your bloody crime

972
01:19:07,564 --> 01:19:11,244
You have murdered me

973
01:19:11,838 --> 01:19:15,077
You have murdered me

974
01:19:15,525 --> 01:19:22,334
You have murdered me Murdered me
Murdered me Murdered me

975
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:53,456
Jesus

976
01:19:56,234 --> 01:20:01,913
Poor old Judas

977
01:20:02,228 --> 01:20:07,779
So long Judas

978
01:20:08,554 --> 01:20:14,012
Poor old Judas

979
01:20:14,399 --> 01:20:19,847
So long Judas

980
01:20:20,556 --> 01:20:25,968
Poor old Judas

981
01:20:26,361 --> 01:20:32,022
So long Judas

982
01:20:32,646 --> 01:20:37,852
Poor old Judas

983
01:20:38,286 --> 01:20:43,780
So long Judas

984
01:20:44,534 --> 01:20:49,913
Poor old Judas

985
01:20:50,250 --> 01:20:55,456
So long Judas

986
01:21:02,635 --> 01:21:07,439
And so the King
Is once again my guest

987
01:21:08,638 --> 01:21:14,295
And why is this
Was Herod unimpressed

988
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:18,244
We turn to Rome

989
01:21:18,245 --> 01:21:22,045
To sentence Nazareth

990
01:21:22,256 --> 01:21:25,593
We have no law

991
01:21:25,594 --> 01:21:30,642
To put a man to death

992
01:21:30,643 --> 01:21:35,581
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do

993
01:21:35,600 --> 01:21:41,357
We need him crucified
It's all you have to do

994
01:21:43,216 --> 01:21:46,877
Talk to me Jesus Christ You have been brought here

995
01:21:46,928 --> 01:21:52,080
Manacled beaten by your own people Do
you have the first idea why you deserve it

996
01:21:52,081 --> 01:21:55,775
Listen King of the Jews Where is your kingdom

997
01:21:55,776 --> 01:21:58,599
Look at me Am I a Jew

998
01:21:58,600 --> 01:22:03,641
I have got no kingdom In this
world I'm through Through through

999
01:22:03,650 --> 01:22:04,840
Talk to me Jesus Christ

1000
01:22:04,850 --> 01:22:11,131
There may be a kingdom for me somewhere
If I only knew

1001
01:22:11,470 --> 01:22:12,698
Then you are a king

1002
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:16,870
That's what you say I am
I look for truth and find that I get damned

1003
01:22:16,878 --> 01:22:22,225
But what is truth Not easy to define We
both have truths Are yours the same as mine

1004
01:22:22,226 --> 01:22:24,417
Crucify him Crucify him

1005
01:22:24,418 --> 01:22:27,074
What do you mean You'd crucify your king

1006
01:22:27,075 --> 01:22:28,703
We have no king but Caesar

1007
01:22:29,083 --> 01:22:31,778
He's done no wrong No not the slightest thing

1008
01:22:31,779 --> 01:22:34,536
We have no king but Caesar Crucify him

1009
01:22:34,537 --> 01:22:37,135
Well this is new Respect for Caesar

1010
01:22:37,265 --> 01:22:39,780
Till now this has been noticeably lacking

1011
01:22:39,770 --> 01:22:42,480
Who is this Jesus Why is he different

1012
01:22:42,524 --> 01:22:45,448
You Jews produce messiahs by the sackful

1013
01:22:45,449 --> 01:22:49,439
We need him crucified It's all you have to do

1014
01:22:49,449 --> 01:22:54,185
We need him crucified It's all you have to do

1015
01:22:54,186 --> 01:22:57,813
Talk to me Jesus Christ

1016
01:23:07,991 --> 01:23:09,664
Look at your Jesus Christ

1017
01:23:09,665 --> 01:23:11,516
I'll agree he's mad

1018
01:23:11,517 --> 01:23:13,059
Ought to be locked up

1019
01:23:13,060 --> 01:23:15,599
But that is not a reason to destroy him

1020
01:23:15,600 --> 01:23:19,529
He's a sad little man not a king or God

1021
01:23:19,530 --> 01:23:21,904
Not a thief I need a crime

1022
01:23:21,905 --> 01:23:24,640
Kill him he says he's God He's a blasphemer

1023
01:23:24,650 --> 01:23:27,538
He'll conquer you and us and even Caesar

1024
01:23:27,539 --> 01:23:30,331
Do it Kill him

1025
01:23:30,332 --> 01:23:32,612
Crucify him Crucify him

1026
01:23:32,613 --> 01:23:35,350
Behold the man behold your shattered king

1027
01:23:35,390 --> 01:23:37,320
We have no king but Caesar

1028
01:23:37,321 --> 01:23:40,024
You hypocrites you hate us more than him

1029
01:23:40,025 --> 01:23:42,772
We have no king but Caesar Crucify him

1030
01:23:42,773 --> 01:23:45,259
I find no reason I see no evil

1031
01:23:45,260 --> 01:23:47,851
This man is harmless so why does he upset you

1032
01:23:47,852 --> 01:23:50,852
He's just misguided thinks he's important

1033
01:23:50,853 --> 01:23:53,720
But to keep you vultures happy I shall flog him

1034

Why do you not speak
When I have your life in my hands

How can you stay quiet
I don't believe you understand

1087
01:26:02,733 --> 01:26:04,485
You have nothing in your hands

01:26:04,556 --> 01:26:09,328
Any power you have comes to you from far beyond

Pilate crucify him Crucify

So crucify him

1094
01:26:23,801 --> 01:26:27,743
Remember Caesar
You'll be demoted you'll be deported

1095
01:26:27,730 --> 01:26:29,238
Crucify him

1096

Remember Caesar

1097
01:26:30,532 --> 01:26:34,244
You have a duty to keep the peace So crucify him

1098

You'll be demoted you'll be deported

1100

1102
01:26:40,956 --> 01:26:44,909

You'll be demoted you'll be deported

1105
01:26:48,850 --> 01:26:50,929
Crucify him

1106
01:26:50,930 --> 01:26:53,088
Don't let me stop

1107
01:26:53,609 --> 01:26:57,081
Your great selfdestruction

1108
01:26:57,579 --> 01:27:00,561
Die if you want to

1109
01:27:00,800 --> 01:27:04,769
You misguided martyr

1110
01:27:05,235 --> 01:27:07,507
I wash my hands

1111
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:11,281
Of your demolition

1112
01:27:11,610 --> 01:27:15,171
Die if you want to

1113
01:27:15,172 --> 01:27:20,601
You innocent puppet

1114
01:27:59,522 --> 01:28:03,021
Every time I look at you I don't understand

1115
01:28:03,022 --> 01:28:07,129
Why you let the things you did get so out of hand

1116
01:28:07,130 --> 01:28:10,970
You'd have managed better if you'd had it planned

1117
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:14,985
Why'd you choose such a backwards time and such a strange land

1118
01:28:14,970 --> 01:28:18,928
If you'd come today you would have reached a whole nation

1119
01:28:18,929 --> 01:28:22,008
Israel in 4 B. C had no mass communication

1120
01:28:22,009 --> 01:28:23,575
Don't you get me wrong

Hey let's go

1148
01:29:17,463 --> 01:29:20,729
Tell me what you think about your friends at the top

1149
01:29:21,317 --> 01:29:24,533
Who do you think besides yourself's the pick of the crop

Buddha was he where it's at Is he where you are

1151
01:29:28,995 --> 01:29:33,073
Could Muhammad move a mountain baby or did he just have good PR

1152
01:29:33,074 --> 01:29:36,108
Did you mean to die like that Was that a mistake

1153
01:29:36,109 --> 01:29:40,284
Or did you know that your messy death would be a record breaker

1154
01:29:40,317 --> 01:29:41,198

1216
01:32:05,307 --> 01:32:07,087
God forgive them

1217
01:32:08,009 --> 01:32:10,786

1218
01:32:24,089 --> 01:32:25,564

into your hands

01:33:45,073 --> 01:33:49,800
I commend
my spirit

1227
01:39:49,458 --> 01:39:51,443
Thank you Thanks again

1228
01:39:52,598 --> 01:39:53,695
Oh my gosh

1229
01:40:00,885 --> 01:40:01,194
I

1230
01:40:03,286 --> 01:40:05,139
I just don't know really what to say

1231
01:40:05,611 --> 01:40:07,249
Thank you to everybody

1232
01:40:07,249 --> 01:40:10,881
I mean what an extraordinary thing for me to see this brought back

1233
01:40:10,881 --> 01:40:14,756
to where I'd hoped it would always be in a rock and roll arena

1234
01:40:14,802 --> 01:40:19,881
And with this fabulous fabulous cast

1235
01:40:19,975 --> 01:40:23,938
One of the problems about being in a rock venue is

1236
01:40:23,930 --> 01:40:26,366
Tim will tell you and Mel will tell you

1237
01:40:27,752 --> 01:40:29,964
is that what happens is that about this time of night

1238
01:40:29,970 --> 01:40:33,929
the set gets moved so we could be here

1239
01:40:33,939 --> 01:40:37,068
And if I talked for hours and I said thank you to everybody

1240
01:40:37,010 --> 01:40:40,961
bits and pieces of the scenery would start to be removed from underneath me

1241
01:40:40,970 --> 01:40:42,469
and all of us

1242
01:40:42,670 --> 01:40:46,082
So I'm gonna keep it very very simple and I'd like to say

1243
01:40:46,208 --> 01:40:48,407
thank you to our fantastic cast

1244
01:40:48,567 --> 01:40:50,206
And

1245
01:40:52,447 --> 01:40:55,508
And Laurence Connor who directed the show so brilliantly

1246
01:40:57,421 --> 01:41:00,631
And our wonderful live rock band

1247
01:41:00,790 --> 01:41:02,890
We are live remember that

1248
01:41:03,809 --> 01:41:06,387
And just before they clear the set away

1249
01:41:06,566 --> 01:41:08,537
this may sound very very strange

1250
01:41:08,510 --> 01:41:12,228
I would like to dedicate this performance to one person

1251
01:41:12,140 --> 01:41:15,132
who was with me when Superstar was written

1252
01:41:15,132 --> 01:41:17,760
Her name was Sarah and I'd like to say

1253
01:41:17,779 --> 01:41:20,459
if you're in the audience Sarah thank you for coming

1254
01:41:21,896 --> 01:41:23,651
Thank you all of you

1255
01:41:47,001 --> 01:41:48,430

Superstar

1263
01:42:09,028 --> 01:42:10,168
Do you think you're what they say you are

1264
01:42:10,457 --> 01:42:12,578
Jesus Christ

1265

Superstar

1266
