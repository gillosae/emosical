(SCATTING)

1270
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:54,800
To your heart

1271
01:23:57,200 --> 01:23:59,120
Got to be true

1272
01:23:59,200 --> 01:24:02,000
Be true, true, true, true, true

1273
01:24:02,080 --> 01:24:04,040
To your heart

1274
01:24:04,880 --> 01:24:06,680
(SLOW SONG PLAYING)

1275
01:24:12,640 --> 01:24:15,080
WOMAN : (SINGING) Look at me

1276
01:24:15,105 --> 01:24:20,200
You may think you see who I really am

1277
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,760
But you'll never know me

1278
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,120
Every day

1279
01:24:25,200 --> 01:24:30,375
It's as if I play a part

1280
01:24:30,400 --> 01:24:32,520
Now I see

1281
01:24:32,600 --> 01:24:37,810
If I wear a mask, I can fool the world

1282
01:24:37,835 --> 01:24:43,360
But I cannot fool my heart

1283
01:24:45,160 --> 01:24:50,440
Who is that girl I see

1284
01:24:50,520 --> 01:24:55,280
Staring straight back at me?

1285
01:24:55,360 --> 01:25:01,096
When will my reflection show

1286
01:25:01,121 --> 01:25:06,600
Who I am inside?

1287
01:25:07,640 --> 01:25:10,040
I am now

1288
01:25:10,120 --> 01:25:15,240
In a world where I have to hide my heart

1289
01:25:15,320 --> 01:25:17,840
And what I believe in

1290
01:25:17,920 --> 01:25:20,000
But somehow

1291
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:22,741
I will show the world

1292
01:25:22,766 --> 01:25:25,200
What's inside my heart

1293
01:25:25,280 --> 01:25:30,061
And be loved for who I am

1294
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:38,040
Who is that girl I see

1295
01:25:38,120 --> 01:25:42,840
Staring straight back at me?

1296
01:25:42,920 --> 01:25:46,800
Why is my reflection

1297
01:25:46,825 --> 01:25:52,680
Someone I don't know?

1298
01:25:52,760 --> 01:25:58,120
Must I pretend that I'm

1299
01:25:58,200 --> 01:26:02,840
Someone else for all time?

1300
01:26:02,920 --> 01:26:08,040
When will my reflection show

1301
01:26:08,120 --> 01:26:13,616
Who I am? Inside, there's a heart

1302
01:26:13,641 --> 01:26:16,800
That must be free

1303
01:26:16,880 --> 01:26:19,760
To fly

1304
01:26:19,840 --> 01:26:21,920
And I burn

1305
01:26:22,000 --> 01:26:24,960
With a need to know

1306
01:26:25,040 --> 01:26:30,520
The reason why

1307
01:26:30,600 --> 01:26:35,680
Why must we all conceal

1308
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,215
What we think, how we feel?

1309
01:26:40,240 --> 01:26:44,960
Must there be a secret me

1310
01:26:45,040 --> 01:26:50,000
I'm forced to hide?

1311
01:26:50,080 --> 01:26:55,520
I won't pretend that I'm

1312
01:26:55,600 --> 01:27:00,240
Someone else for all time

1313
01:27:00,360 --> 01:27:05,560
When will my reflection show

1314
01:27:05,640 --> 01:27:12,328
Who I am inside?

1315
01:27:12,960 --> 01:27:18,680
When will my reflection show

1316
01:27:18,800 --> 01:27:22,840
Who I am inside?

1317
01:27:25,240 --> 01:27:29,520
Oh, yeah
