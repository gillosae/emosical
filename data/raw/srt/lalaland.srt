387
00:31:50,056 --> 00:31:52,818

00:32:32,411 --> 00:32:37,828
Sebastian Wilder : A silver shine that stretches to the sea

401
00:32:40,099 --> 00:32:47,451
Sebastian Wilder : We've stumbled on a view That's tailormade for two

402
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:53,760
Sebastian Wilder : What a shame those two are you and me

403

414
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:35,848
Sebastian Wilder : But you'll call

Mia Dolan : You're right I'd never fall for you at all

418
00:33:42,158 --> 00:33:45,848
Mia Dolan : And maybe this appeals

419
00:33:45,849 --> 00:33:48,780
Mia Dolan : To someone not in heels

420
00:33:48,781 --> 00:33:52,334
Mia Dolan : Or to any girl who feels

Sebastian Wilder : Oh okay

508
00:40:52,408 --> 00:40:56,463
Mia Dolan : She was in a travelling theatre company I grew up in Boulder City Nevada

509
00:40:57,127 --> 00:41:01,062
Mia Dolan : So across the street from my house there was this little library that had an old movie section

510
00:41:01,397 --> 00:41:05,898
Mia Dolan : So she took me and we spent an entire day watching all these old movies

511
00:41:05,979 --> 00:41:09,388
Mia Dolan : like Notorious and Bringing Up Baby and Casablanca

512
00:41:10,445 --> 00:41:10,821

00:41:13,521 --> 00:41:14,464
Sebastian Wilder : She sounds incredible

517
00:41:14,488 --> 00:41:15,482
Mia Dolan : She was incredible

518
00:41:15,507 --> 00:41:18,131
Mia Dolan : And I would put on all these plays in my bedroom

519
00:41:18,194 --> 00:41:23,017
Mia Dolan : and it would basically just be she and I reenacting those scenes from the movies

520
00:41:23,734 --> 00:41:25,131
Mia Dolan : And then I would write my own plays

521
00:41:25,132 --> 00:41:25,421
Sebastian Wilder : Wow

522
00:41:25,422 --> 00:41:26,151
Mia Dolan : Um Yeah

523
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:48,525
Mia Dolan : I love it

524
00:41:53,238 --> 00:41:56,449
Mia Dolan : So anyway I left college after two years to come here

525
00:41:56,450 --> 00:42:01,488
Mia Dolan : and um my last audition was for a teen show pitched as Dangerous Minds meets The O. C

526
00:42:01,688 --> 00:42:05,078
Mia Dolan : So yeah should've been a lawyer

527
00:42:06,031 --> 00:42:07,651
Sebastian Wilder : Cause the world needs more lawyers

528
00:42:08,660 --> 00:42:10,195
Mia Dolan : It doesn't need more actresses

529
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:11,759
Sebastian Wilder : You're not just an actress

530
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:13,211
Mia Dolan : What do you mean just an actress

531
00:42:13,212 --> 00:42:16,648
Sebastian Wilder : You said it yourself You're a child prodigy playwright

532
00:42:16,649 --> 00:42:18,300
Mia Dolan : That is not what I said

533
00:42:18,379 --> 00:42:20,521
Sebastian Wilder : Well you're too modest to say it but it's true

534
00:42:21,899 --> 00:42:27,057
Sebastian Wilder : You could just write your own roles you know Write something that's as interesting as you are and you don't have to audition for this

535
00:42:27,097 --> 00:42:27,630
Mia Dolan : Yeah

536
00:42:27,631 --> 00:42:28,706
Sebastian Wilder : Uh pissy caca

537
00:42:28,798 --> 00:42:32,959
Sebastian Wilder : Look at Louis Armstrong He could've just played the marching band charts that he was given

538
00:42:32,984 --> 00:42:34,400
Sebastian Wilder : But he didn't do that What did he do

539
00:42:34,907 --> 00:42:35,634
Mia Dolan : What did he do

540
00:42:35,658 --> 00:42:37,448
Sebastian Wilder : Well he made history didn't he

541
00:42:38,065 --> 00:42:40,860
Mia Dolan : Well I'm gonna stop auditioning and I'm gonna make history instead

542
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:44,091
Sebastian Wilder : Well my work is done here

543
00:42:45,771 --> 00:42:49,201
Mia Dolan : I should probably tell you something now just to get it out of the way

544
00:42:49,202 --> 00:42:49,426
Sebastian Wilder : Mmhmm

545
00:42:49,427 --> 00:42:50,801
Mia Dolan : I hate jazz

546
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,833
Mia Dolan : Are you okay

547
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:55,797
Sebastian Wilder : What do you mean you hate jazz

548
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,446
Mia Dolan : It just means that when I listen to it I don't like it

549
00:42:58,447 --> 00:43:00,469
Sebastian Wilder : Yeah but it's such a blanket statement you don't like jazz

550
00:43:01,092 --> 00:43:03,118
Sebastian Wilder : What are you doing right now

551
00:43:04,341 --> 00:43:04,865
Mia Dolan : Nothing

552
00:43:22,598 --> 00:43:25,075
Sebastian Wilder : I just think that people when they say that they

553
00:43:26,305 --> 00:43:27,525
Sebastian Wilder : you know hate jazz

554
00:43:29,076 --> 00:43:32,924
Sebastian Wilder : They just They don't have context they don't know where it comes from

555
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:37,546
Sebastian Wilder : You know Jazz was born in a little flophouse in New Orleans

556
00:43:37,551 --> 00:43:42,286
Sebastian Wilder : and it's just because people were crammed in there they spoke five different languages they couldn't talk to each other

557
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:45,835
Sebastian Wilder : The only way they could communicate was with jazz

558
00:43:45,836 --> 00:43:47,579
Mia Dolan : You know what about Kenny G

559
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:49,558
Sebastian Wilder : What

560
00:43:49,582 --> 00:43:50,789
Mia Dolan : What about Kenny G

561
00:43:50,790 --> 00:43:52,577
Mia Dolan : I mean what about elevator music

562
00:43:52,578 --> 00:43:55,288
Mia Dolan : You know jazz music that I know

563
00:43:55,292 --> 00:43:56,180
Sebastian Wilder : What about it

564
00:43:56,204 --> 00:43:57,059
Mia Dolan : From my life

565
00:43:57,184 --> 00:43:59,647
Sebastian Wilder : Mmhmm I just find it relaxing

566
00:43:59,648 --> 00:44:01,857
Sebastian Wilder : It's not relaxing It's not It's not

567
00:44:01,882 --> 00:44:05,322
Sebastian Wilder : Sidney Bechet shot somebody because they told him he played a wrong note

568
00:44:05,323 --> 00:44:06,673
Sebastian Wilder : That's hardly relaxing

569
00:44:06,674 --> 00:44:10,417
Mia Dolan : Yeah but where I grew up there was this station called KJAZZ 103

570
00:44:10,715 --> 00:44:13,998
Mia Dolan : And people would just put on that station when they had a cocktail party

571
00:44:14,184 --> 00:44:14,934
Sebastian Wilder : Right

572
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:17,158
Mia Dolan : And everyone would kind of just talk over it

573
00:44:17,550 --> 00:44:18,402
Sebastian Wilder : I know

574
00:44:18,403 --> 00:44:19,035
Mia Dolan : Cause it was

575
00:44:19,036 --> 00:44:23,332
Sebastian Wilder : That's the prob Okay okay So I think that's part of the problem is that you can't hear it you know

576
00:44:23,337 --> 00:44:26,593
Sebastian Wilder : You have to see it You have to see what's at stake I mean look at these fellas

577
00:44:26,618 --> 00:44:31,088
Sebastian Wilder : Look at the sax player right now He just hijacked the song He's on his own trip

578
00:44:31,089 --> 00:44:34,610
Sebastian Wilder : Every one of these guys is composing they're rearranging they're writing

579
00:44:34,661 --> 00:44:36,385
Sebastian Wilder : and they're playing the melody They're just

580
00:44:36,392 --> 00:44:37,989
Sebastian Wilder : And now look the trumpet player

581
00:44:38,047 --> 00:44:39,271
Sebastian Wilder : He's got his own idea

582
00:44:39,309 --> 00:44:43,390
Sebastian Wilder : And so it's conflict and it's compromise and it's just

583
00:44:43,898 --> 00:44:46,871
Sebastian Wilder : It's new every time It's brandnew every night

584
00:44:46,872 --> 00:44:49,055
Sebastian Wilder : It's very very exciting

585
00:44:56,097 --> 00:44:59,369
Sebastian Wilder : And it's dying It's dying Mia

586
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:00,943
Sebastian Wilder : It's dying on the vine

587
00:45:00,944 --> 00:45:04,079
Sebastian Wilder : And the world says Let it die It had its time

588
00:45:04,342 --> 00:45:05,777
Sebastian Wilder : Well not on my watch

589
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:08,548
