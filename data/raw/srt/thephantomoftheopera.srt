606

02:03:20,060 --> 02:03:22,597
Erik (The Phantom) : Buy his freedom with your love

1538
02:03:22,598 --> 02:03:26,056
Erik (The Phantom) : Refuse me and you send your lover to his death

1539
02:03:26,057 --> 02:03:27,924
Erik (The Phantom) : This is the choice

1540
02:03:27,925 --> 02:03:38,047
Erik (The Phantom) : This is the point of no return

1541
02:03:39,939 --> 02:03:44,556
Christine Daaé : The tears I might have shed

1542
02:03:44,557 --> 02:03:48,303
Christine Daaé : For your dark fate

1543
02:03:48,304 --> 02:03:51,618
Christine Daaé : Grow cold

1544
02:03:51,619 --> 02:03:58,177
Christine Daaé : And turn to tears of hate

1545
02:03:59,609 --> 02:04:03,890
Raoul : Christine forgive me Please forgive me

1546
02:04:04,577 --> 02:04:05,388
Raoul : I did it all for you and all for nothing

1547
02:04:05,389 --> 02:04:11,002
Christine Daaé : Farewell my fallen idol and false friend

1548
02:04:11,027 --> 02:04:11,320
Erik (The Phantom) : Too late for turning back

1549
02:04:11,321 --> 02:04:12,637
Christine Daaé : We had such hopes And now such hopes are shattered

1550
02:04:12,638 --> 02:04:14,745
Erik (The Phantom) : Too late for prayers and useless pity

1551
02:04:14,784 --> 02:04:16,243
Raoul : Say you love him and Past

1552
02:04:16,244 --> 02:04:18,305
Erik (The Phantom) : all hopes of cries for help

1553
02:04:18,330 --> 02:04:19,893
Raoul : My life is over

1554
02:04:19,894 --> 02:04:22,213
Erik (The Phantom) : No point in fighting

1555
02:04:22,214 --> 02:04:24,582
Raoul : Either way you choose he has to win

1556
02:04:24,583 --> 02:04:28,570
Erik (The Phantom) : Either way you choose you cannot win

1557
02:04:28,836 --> 02:04:32,727
Erik (The Phantom) : So do you end your days with me

1558
02:04:32,728 --> 02:04:35,658
Erik (The Phantom) : Or do you send him to his grave

1559
02:04:35,659 --> 02:04:38,394
Raoul : Why make her lie to you

1560
02:04:38,395 --> 02:04:41,229
Raoul : To save me

1561
02:04:42,817 --> 02:04:44,550
Erik (The Phantom) : Past the point of no return

1562
02:04:44,551 --> 02:04:46,092
Christine Daaé : Angel of Music

1563
02:04:46,093 --> 02:04:47,297
Raoul : For pity's sake

1564
02:04:47,298 --> 02:04:48,303
Christine Daaé : Who deserve this

1565
02:04:48,304 --> 02:04:50,533
Erik (The Phantom) : Christine The final threshold

1566
02:04:50,558 --> 02:04:55,057
Erik (The Phantom) : His life is now the prize which you must earn

1567
02:04:55,058 --> 02:04:58,409
Raoul : I fought so hard to free you

1568
02:04:58,540 --> 02:05:00,764
Erik (The Phantom) : You've past the point of no return

1569
02:05:00,765 --> 02:05:04,613
Christine Daaé : Angel of Music

1570
02:05:04,614 --> 02:05:07,085
Christine Daaé : You deceived me

1571
02:05:07,086 --> 02:05:12,414
Christine Daaé : I gave my mind blindly

1572
02:05:17,136 --> 02:05:18,490
Erik (The Phantom) : Blindly

1573
02:05:33,937 --> 02:05:38,948
Erik (The Phantom) : You try my patience

1574
02:05:45,672 --> 02:05:47,498
Erik (The Phantom) : Make your choice

1575
02:05:54,264 --> 02:06:00,858
Christine Daaé : Pitiful creature of darkness

1576
02:06:03,408 --> 02:06:09,221
Christine Daaé : What kind of life have you known

1577
02:06:11,774 --> 02:06:17,894
Christine Daaé : God give me courage to show you

1578
02:06:17,895 --> 02:06:27,895
Christine Daaé : You are not alone

1579
02:08:12,096 --> 02:08:14,765
Ensemble : Track down this murderer

1580
02:08:15,311 --> 02:08:16,433
Ensemble : He must be found

1581
02:08:16,434 --> 02:08:19,317
Erik (The Phantom) : Take her forget me forget all of this

1582
02:08:21,126 --> 02:08:25,077
Erik (The Phantom) : Leave me alone Forget all you've seen

1583
02:08:25,102 --> 02:08:27,287
Erik (The Phantom) : Go now don't let them find you

1584
02:08:28,402 --> 02:08:29,247
Ensemble : Revenge for Buquet

1585
02:08:29,248 --> 02:08:30,293
Erik (The Phantom) : Take the boat

1586
02:08:30,318 --> 02:08:32,190
Erik (The Phantom) : Swear to me never to tell

1587
02:08:34,399 --> 02:08:36,019
Erik (The Phantom) : Of the secret you know

1588
02:08:37,315 --> 02:08:40,423
Ensemble : The Phantom of the Opera

1589
02:08:40,424 --> 02:08:44,264
Erik (The Phantom) : of this Angel of Hell

1590
02:08:45,769 --> 02:08:46,976
Erik (The Phantom) : Go

1591
02:08:50,410 --> 02:08:56,877
Erik (The Phantom) : Go now and leave me

1592
02:09:18,734 --> 02:09:20,629
Erik (The Phantom) : Masquerade

1593
02:09:22,983 --> 02:09:26,810
Erik (The Phantom) : Paper faces on parade

1594
02:09:26,993 --> 02:09:29,605
Erik (The Phantom) : Masquerade

1595
02:09:31,507 --> 02:09:34,856
Erik (The Phantom) : Hide your face So the world

1596
02:09:38,103 --> 02:09:39,997
Erik (The Phantom) : Will never find you

1597
02:10:02,530 --> 02:10:04,783
Erik (The Phantom) : Christine

1598
02:10:06,678 --> 02:10:18,859
Erik (The Phantom) : I love you

1599
02:10:52,897 --> 02:10:59,070
Christine Daaé : Say you'll share with me

1600
02:10:59,071 --> 02:11:05,249
Christine Daaé : One love one lifetime

1601
02:11:06,008 --> 02:11:10,548
Erik (The Phantom) : Say the word

1602
02:11:10,549 --> 02:11:15,171
Erik (The Phantom) : And I will follow you

1603
02:11:18,875 --> 02:11:24,236
Christine Daaé : Share each day with me

1604
02:11:24,237 --> 02:11:31,620
Christine Daaé : Each night each morning

1605
02:11:31,621 --> 02:11:35,915
Erik (The Phantom) : You alone can make

1606
02:11:35,916 --> 02:11:41,288
Erik (The Phantom) : My song take flight

1607
02:11:41,289 --> 02:11:45,467
Erik (The Phantom) : It's over now

1608
02:11:45,468 --> 02:11:49,011
Erik (The Phantom) : The music

1609
02:11:49,012 --> 02:11:53,486
Erik (The Phantom) : Of the

1610
02:11:53,487 --> 02:12:02,560
Erik (The Phantom) : night

1611
02:18:07,159 --> 02:18:08,276
Thank you

1612
02:18:14,925 --> 02:18:16,626
Oh thank you Thank you

1613
02:18:17,380 --> 02:18:21,444
Gosh uh do sit down for goodness sake I might talk for too long

1614
02:18:22,059 --> 02:18:25,692
Gosh when I was a little boy and I was first brought here by my mother

1615
02:18:25,717 --> 02:18:29,049
when I was five I think to a Promenade concert

1616
02:18:29,074 --> 02:18:32,033
I think I heard Beethoven's Third Symphony

1617
02:18:32,058 --> 02:18:35,424
and I don't think I could have ever ever believed

1618
02:18:35,449 --> 02:18:38,677
sitting somewhere up there

1619
02:18:38,702 --> 02:18:41,872
that anything like this would ever happen to my music

1620
02:18:41,953 --> 02:18:47,841
And I have to thank immediately Cameron Mackintosh What an extraordinary production he's put together

1621
02:18:51,158 --> 02:18:53,580
Thank you Cameron We'll meet him in a moment

1622
02:18:55,199 --> 02:19:01,224
But before I go any further the wonderful thing about musicals is that

1623
02:19:01,486 --> 02:19:03,872
something has to happen that brings them all together

1624
02:19:03,897 --> 02:19:07,156
I mean you can have a really great musical and

1625
02:19:07,180 --> 02:19:11,142
One aspect of it could be wrong whether it be the production whether it be something to do

1626
02:19:11,196 --> 02:19:15,458
With how it's staged or anything and it might get buried and then take years to find again

1627
02:19:15,483 --> 02:19:21,973
But what happened so extraordinarily with this is that everything came together with Cameron as the producer

1628
02:19:22,844 --> 02:19:25,063
Before we go any further I have to say that

1629
02:19:25,088 --> 02:19:28,969
it would have never happened without Maria Bjrnson and of course

1630
02:19:30,314 --> 02:19:32,017
Maria Bjrnson

1631
02:19:36,144 --> 02:19:39,835
was as all of you know the incredible designer of the show

1632
02:19:39,860 --> 02:19:42,967
It was her vision combined I think with everything else

1633
02:19:42,992 --> 02:19:47,468
that really brought us along She tragically died some years ago

1634
02:19:47,493 --> 02:19:50,198
One of the greatest sadnesses is that she's not here tonight

1635
02:19:50,223 --> 02:19:52,900
but I hope we've honoured her spirit in every way

1636
02:19:53,257 --> 02:19:56,798
So Maria thank you

1637
02:20:00,946 --> 02:20:07,427
And I ought to say tonight's rather extraordinary because I know that there are many companies of The Phantom of the Opera

1638
02:20:07,452 --> 02:20:11,405
watching this performance around the world because it's being beamed around the world tonight

1639
02:20:11,699 --> 02:20:15,817
And none I suppose more important than the director who made it possible

1640
02:20:15,842 --> 02:20:19,716
who's in New York at the moment with the New York Broadway company

1641
02:20:19,804 --> 02:20:21,424
Hal Prince So hello Hal

1642
02:20:25,246 --> 02:20:27,465
And thank you for everything Hal

1643
02:20:28,845 --> 02:20:32,938
So without any more ado let's bring on the original creative team from London

1644
02:20:32,963 --> 02:20:35,931
Here they come led by Sir Cameron Mackintosh

1645
02:20:40,391 --> 02:20:42,537
Charles Hart our lyricist of course

1646
02:20:43,033 --> 02:20:46,961
Andy Bridge our lighting and above all Gillian Lynne who staged tonight

1647
02:20:47,027 --> 02:20:48,080
Thank you Gillian

1648
02:20:53,447 --> 02:20:57,080
And the creative team from the Albert Hall tonight

1649
02:20:57,105 --> 02:20:57,966
Here they all are

1650
02:21:03,420 --> 02:21:04,954
Laurence the director in the middle

1651
02:21:15,446 --> 02:21:16,142
Now

1652
02:21:17,507 --> 02:21:21,432
Next I have to thank our fantastic company What a fantastic show

1653
02:21:21,457 --> 02:21:25,245
Ramin Sierra you couldn't have done me more proud

1654
02:21:26,269 --> 02:21:30,312
And Anthony Inglis and the fantastic orchestra

1655
02:21:37,204 --> 02:21:38,529
Just before we move on

1656
02:21:38,554 --> 02:21:45,590
I'm going to introduce you in a second to the original London company but I just would like you to remember John Aron

1657
02:21:45,615 --> 02:21:48,764
Steve Barton who of course played Raoul and Mary Millar

1658
02:21:49,036 --> 02:21:53,577
who sadly are no longer with us but they were wonderful members of our original team

1659
02:21:53,620 --> 02:21:56,566
So a small appreciation to them please

1660
02:22:01,891 --> 02:22:05,886
And here is our original London company

1661
02:22:36,196 --> 02:22:41,484
We have one other member of the company tonight

1662
02:22:41,576 --> 02:22:44,410
who has hotfooted it from the London Palladium

1663
02:22:44,617 --> 02:22:45,672
Michael Crawford

1664
02:23:36,911 --> 02:23:37,752
Finally

1665
02:23:39,291 --> 02:23:41,218
And I suppose this is very special for me

1666
02:23:41,497 --> 02:23:44,364
It is a great joy for me to welcome tonight

1667
02:23:44,882 --> 02:23:47,132
my Angel of Music Sarah Brightman

1668
02:24:25,419 --> 02:24:25,636
But

1669
02:24:31,808 --> 02:24:33,771
Without these two we would not be here

1670
02:24:33,796 --> 02:24:37,740
Uh we have one slight additional surprise

1671
02:24:37,765 --> 02:24:39,621
Sarah has agreed to sing

1672
02:24:39,646 --> 02:24:41,355
So I'm going to leave you

1673
02:24:43,564 --> 02:24:46,365
in the hands of the Angel of Music

1674
02:24:46,584 --> 02:24:48,752
Maestro take it away

1675
02:25:08,676 --> 02:25:12,558
In sleep he sang to me

1676
02:25:12,583 --> 02:25:15,788
In dreams he came

1677
02:25:16,573 --> 02:25:20,692
That voice which calls to me

1678
02:25:20,717 --> 02:25:23,709
And speaks my name

1679
02:25:24,713 --> 02:25:28,671
And do I dream again

1680
02:25:28,696 --> 02:25:33,691
For now I find

1681
02:25:33,716 --> 02:25:40,218
The Phantom of the Opera is there

1682
02:25:40,559 --> 02:25:46,677
Inside my mind

1683
02:25:52,699 --> 02:25:56,442
Sing once again with me

1684
02:25:56,746 --> 02:26:00,255
Our strange duet

1685
02:26:00,901 --> 02:26:04,481
My power over you

1686
02:26:04,506 --> 02:26:08,736
Grows stronger yet

1687
02:26:08,761 --> 02:26:12,504
And though you turn from me

1688
02:26:12,529 --> 02:26:17,715
To glance behind

1689
02:26:17,740 --> 02:26:24,707
The Phantom of the Opera is there

1690
02:26:24,732 --> 02:26:29,518
Inside your mind

1691
02:26:36,511 --> 02:26:40,739
Those who have seen your face

1692
02:26:40,764 --> 02:26:44,793
Draw back in fear

1693
02:26:44,818 --> 02:26:48,772
I am the mask you wear

1694
02:26:48,797 --> 02:26:52,358
It's me they hear

1695
02:26:52,773 --> 02:26:56,752
My spirit and your voice Your spirit and my voice

1696
02:26:56,777 --> 02:27:01,663
In one combined

1697
02:27:01,688 --> 02:27:08,719
The Phantom of the Opera is there

1698
02:27:08,744 --> 02:27:17,542
Inside your mind Inside my mind He's there The Phantom of the Opera

1699
02:27:17,760 --> 02:27:26,749
Beware The Phantom of the Opera

1700
02:27:28,709 --> 02:27:32,667
In all your fantasies

1701
02:27:32,692 --> 02:27:36,788
You always knew

1702
02:27:36,813 --> 02:27:40,950
That man and mystery

1703
02:27:40,975 --> 02:27:44,439
Were both in you

1704
02:27:44,761 --> 02:27:48,675
And in this labyrinth

1705
02:27:48,700 --> 02:27:53,778
Where night is blind

1706
02:27:53,803 --> 02:28:00,467
The Phantom of the Opera is there

1707
02:28:00,492 --> 02:28:06,163
Inside your mind Sing

1708
02:28:06,950 --> 02:28:11,743
Sing my Angel of Music He's there

1709
02:28:11,768 --> 02:28:18,242
The Phantom of the Opera

1710
02:28:18,267 --> 02:28:21,961
Sing for me

1711
02:28:26,643 --> 02:28:28,989
Sing for me

1712
02:29:01,742 --> 02:29:06,021
Sing for me

1713
02:29:24,941 --> 02:29:28,581
We have brought you

1714
02:29:28,606 --> 02:29:31,985
To the seat of sweet music's throne

1715
02:29:32,010 --> 02:29:37,697
To this kingdom where all must pay homage to music

1716
02:29:37,722 --> 02:29:40,946
Music

1717
02:29:41,328 --> 02:29:45,173
We have come here

1718
02:29:45,266 --> 02:29:48,923
For one purpose and one alone

1719
02:29:48,948 --> 02:29:53,027
Since the moment you first heard us sing

1720
02:29:53,052 --> 02:29:58,234
We have needed you with us to serve him

1721
02:29:58,373 --> 02:30:05,380
To sing for his music

1722
02:30:06,840 --> 02:30:14,799
His music

1723
02:30:17,998 --> 02:30:23,284
Nighttime sharpens

1724
02:30:23,309 --> 02:30:27,953
Heightens each sensation

1725
02:30:28,330 --> 02:30:32,603
Darkness stirs

1726
02:30:32,628 --> 02:30:37,804
And wakes imagination

1727
02:30:37,829 --> 02:30:42,617
Silently the senses

1728
02:30:42,755 --> 02:30:50,156
Abandon their defenses

1729
02:30:59,624 --> 02:31:03,823
Slowly gently

1730
02:31:03,848 --> 02:31:08,574
Night unfurls its splendour

1731
02:31:08,904 --> 02:31:12,273
Grasp it sense it

1732
02:31:12,693 --> 02:31:17,437
Tremulous and tender

1733
02:31:17,488 --> 02:31:20,778
Turn your face away

1734
02:31:20,803 --> 02:31:25,355
From the garish light of day

1735
02:31:25,688 --> 02:31:27,930
Turn your thoughts away

1736
02:31:28,069 --> 02:31:33,730
From cold unfeeling light

1737
02:31:33,966 --> 02:31:42,126
And listen to the music of the night

1738
02:31:42,261 --> 02:31:46,199
Close your eyes and surrender

1739
02:31:46,224 --> 02:31:49,383
To your darkest dreams

1740
02:31:49,408 --> 02:31:52,982
Purge your thoughts of the life

1741
02:31:53,007 --> 02:31:57,335
You knew before

1742
02:31:57,360 --> 02:32:02,795
Close your eyes let your spirit

1743
02:32:03,014 --> 02:32:17,508
Start to soar

1744
02:32:19,250 --> 02:32:22,501
And you'll live

1745
02:32:22,526 --> 02:32:31,339
As you've never lived before

1746
02:32:33,401 --> 02:32:37,479
Softly deftly

1747
02:32:37,504 --> 02:32:41,456
Music shall caress you

1748
02:32:41,481 --> 02:32:45,078
Hear it feel it

1749
02:32:45,103 --> 02:32:49,295
Secretly possess you

1750
02:32:49,320 --> 02:32:52,440
Open up your mind

1751
02:32:52,465 --> 02:32:56,501
Let your fantasies unwind

1752
02:32:56,526 --> 02:33:03,871
In this darkness that you know you cannot fight

1753
02:33:04,279 --> 02:33:08,776
The darkness of the music

1754
02:33:08,801 --> 02:33:13,615
Of the night

1755
02:33:13,640 --> 02:33:17,176
Let you mind start a journey

1756
02:33:17,201 --> 02:33:19,863
To a strange new world

1757
02:33:19,960 --> 02:33:26,373
Leave all thoughts of the world you knew before

1758
02:33:26,687 --> 02:33:30,461
Let you soul take you where

1759
02:33:30,486 --> 02:33:39,962
You long to be

1760
02:33:46,980 --> 02:33:50,510
Only then

1761
02:33:51,198 --> 02:33:55,360
Can you belong

1762
02:33:55,456 --> 02:34:01,597
To me

1763
02:34:04,011 --> 02:34:07,986
Floating falling

1764
02:34:08,011 --> 02:34:11,753
Sweet intoxication

1765
02:34:12,177 --> 02:34:16,004
Touch me trust me

1766
02:34:16,029 --> 02:34:20,336
Savour each sensation

1767
02:34:20,361 --> 02:34:23,435
Let the dream begin

1768
02:34:23,601 --> 02:34:27,847
Let your darker side give in

1769
02:34:27,872 --> 02:34:31,949
To the power of the music

1770
02:34:31,974 --> 02:34:35,634
That I write

1771
02:34:36,063 --> 02:34:41,386
The power of the music

1772
02:34:41,411 --> 02:34:50,162
Of the night

1773
02:35:09,011 --> 02:35:12,463
You alone can make

1774
02:35:12,531 --> 02:35:17,881
Our song take flight

1775
02:35:18,172 --> 02:35:21,888
It's over now

1776
02:35:21,913 --> 02:35:26,821
The music of

1777
02:35:26,846 --> 02:35:44,781
The night
